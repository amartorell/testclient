<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MIT researchers have built an ingestible sensor equipped with genetically engineered bacteria that can diagnose bleeding in the stomach or other gastrointestinal problems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This “bacteria-on-a-chip” approach combines sensors made from living cells with ultra-low-power electronics that convert the bacterial response into a wireless signal that can be read by a smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“By combining engineered biological sensors together with low-power wireless electronics, we can detect biological signals in the body and in near real-time, enabling new diagnostic capabilities for human health applications,” says Timothy Lu, an MIT associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science and of biological engineering.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the new study, appearing in the May 24 online edition of &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, the researchers created sensors that respond to heme, a component of blood, and showed that they work in pigs. They also designed sensors that can respond to a molecule that is a marker of inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lu and Anantha Chandrakasan, dean of MIT’s School of Engineering and the Vannevar Bush Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, are the senior authors of the study. The lead authors are graduate student Mark Mimee and former MIT postdoc Phillip Nadeau.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;cms-placeholder-content-video&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wireless communication&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the past decade, synthetic biologists have made great strides in engineering bacteria to respond to stimuli such as environmental pollutants or markers of disease. These bacteria can be designed to produce outputs such as light when they detect the target stimulus, but specialized lab equipment is usually required to measure this response.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To make these bacteria more useful for real-world applications, the MIT team decided to combine them with an electronic chip that could translate the bacterial response into a wireless signal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our idea was to package bacterial cells inside a device,” Nadeau says. “The cells would be trapped and go along for the ride as the device passes through the stomach.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For their initial demonstration, the researchers focused on bleeding in the GI tract. They engineered a probiotic strain of &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; to express a genetic circuit that causes the bacteria to emit light when they encounter heme.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They placed the bacteria into four wells on their custom-designed sensor, covered by a semipermeable membrane that allows small molecules from the surrounding environment to diffuse through. Underneath each well is a phototransistor that can measure the amount of light produced by the bacterial cells and relay the information to a microprocessor that sends a wireless signal to a nearby computer or smartphone. The researchers also built an Android app that can be used to analyze the data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The sensor, which is a cylinder about 1.5 inches long, requires about 13 microwatts of power. The researchers equipped the sensor with a 2.7-volt battery, which they estimate could power the device for about 1.5 months of continuous use. They say it could also be powered by a voltaic cell sustained by acidic fluids in the stomach, using technology that Nadeau and Chandrakasan have &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.mit.edu/2017/engineers-harness-stomach-acid-power-tiny-sensors-0206&quot;&gt;previously developed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The focus of this work is on system design and integration to combine the power of bacterial sensing with ultra-low-power circuits to realize important health sensing applications,” Chandrakasan says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diagnosing disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers tested the ingestible sensor in pigs and showed that it could correctly determine whether any blood was present in the stomach. They anticipate that this type of sensor could be either deployed for one-time use or designed to remain the digestive tract for several days or weeks, sending continuous signals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Currently, if patients are suspected to be bleeding from a gastric ulcer, they have to undergo an endoscopy to diagnose the problem, which often requires the patient to be sedated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The goal with this sensor is that you would be able to circumvent an unnecessary procedure by just ingesting the capsule, and within a relatively short period of time you would know whether or not there was a bleeding event,” Mimee says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To help move the technology toward patient use, the researchers plan to reduce the size of the sensor and to study how long the bacteria cells can survive in the digestive tract. They also hope to develop sensors for gastrointestinal conditions other than bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; paper, the researchers adapted previously described sensors for two other molecules, which they have not yet tested in animals. One of the sensors detects a sulfur-containing ion called thiosulfate, which is linked to inflammation and could be used to monitor patients with Crohn’s disease or other inflammatory conditions. The other detects a bacterial signaling molecule called AHL, which can serve as a marker for gastrointestinal infections because different types of bacteria produce slightly different versions of the molecule.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Most of the work we did in the paper was related to blood, but conceivably you could engineer bacteria to sense anything and produce light in response to that,” Mimee says. “Anyone who is trying to engineer bacteria to sense a molecule related to disease could slot it into one of those wells, and it would be ready to go.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers say the sensors could also be designed to carry multiple strains of bacteria, allowing them to diagnose a variety of conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Right now, we have four detection sites, but if you could extend it to 16 or 256, then you could have multiple different types of cells and be able to read them all out in parallel, enabling more high-throughput screening,” Nadeau says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by Texas Instruments, the Hong Kong Innovation and Technology Fund, the Office of Naval Research, the National Science Foundation, the Center for Microbiome Informatics and Therapeutics, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, a Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship, and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Council of Canada. Chip fabrication was provided by the TSMC University Shuttle Program.&lt;/p&gt;

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Two members of the MIT faculty were &lt;a href=&quot;http://ter.li/2018HHMIInvestigators&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;named&lt;/a&gt; Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) investigators today. &lt;a href=&quot;https://ter.li/HHMI_Boyden&quot;&gt;Ed Boyden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ter.li/HHMI_Zhang&quot;&gt;Feng Zhang&lt;/a&gt; join a community of 300 HHMI scientists who are “transforming biology and medicine, one discovery at a time.” Both researchers have been instrumental in recognizing, developing, and sharing robust tools with broad utility that have revolutionized the life sciences.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
“We are thrilled that Ed and Feng are being recognized in this way” says Robert Desimone, director of the McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT. “Being named to the investigator program recognizes their previous achievements and allows them to follow the innovative path that is a trait of their research.”&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
HHMI selects new Investigators to join its flagship program through periodic competitions. In choosing researchers to join its investigator program, HHMI specifically aims to select ‘people, not projects’ and identifies trail blazers in the biomedical sciences. The organization provides support for an unusual length of time, seven years with a renewal process at the end of that period, thus giving selected scientists the time and freedom to tackle difficult and important biological questions. HHMI-affiliated scientists continue to work at their home institution. The HHMI Investigator program currently funds 300 scientists at 60 research institutions across the United States.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Ed Boyden, the Y. Eva Tan Professor in Neurotechnology at MIT, has pioneered a number of technologies that allow visualization and manipulation of complex biological systems. Boyden worked, along with Karl Deisseroth and Feng Zhang, on optogenetics, a system that leverages microbial opsins to manipulate neuronal activity using light. This technology has transformed our ability to examine neuronal function in vivo. Boyden’s work initiated optogenetics, then extended it into a multicolor, high-speed, and noninvasive toolbox. Subsequent technological advances developed by Boyden and his team include expansion microscopy, an imaging strategy that overcomes the limits of light microscopy by expanding biological specimens in a controlled fashion. Boyden&#039;s team also recently developed a directed evolution system that is capable of robotically screening hundreds of thousands of mutated proteins for specific properties within hours. He and his team recently used the system to develop a high-performance fluorescent voltage indicator.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
“I am honored and excited to become an HHMI investigator,” says Boyden, who is also a member of MIT’s McGovern Institute for Brain Research and Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research and an associate professor in the Program in Media Arts and Sciences at the MIT Media Lab; the MIT Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences; and the MIT Department of Biological Engineering. “This will give my group the ability to open up completely new areas of science, in a way that would not be possible with traditional funding.”&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Feng Zhang is a molecular biologist focused on building new tools for probing the human brain. As a graduate student, Zhang was part of the team that developed optogenetics. Zhang went on to develop other innovative tools. These achievements include the landmark deployment of the microbial CRISPR-Cas9 system for genome engineering in eukaryotic cells. The ease and specificity of the system has led to its widespread use. Zhang has continued to mine bacterial CRISPR systems for additional enzymes with useful properties, leading to the discovery of Cas13, which targets RNA, rather than DNA. By leveraging the unique properties of Cas13, Zhang and his team created a precise RNA editing tool, which may potentially be a safer way to treat genetic diseases because the genome does not need to be cut, as well as a molecular detection system, termed SHERLOCK, which can sense trace amounts of genetic material, such as viruses.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
“It is so exciting to join this exceptional scientific community,” says Zhang, “and be given this opportunity to pursue our research into engineering natural systems.”&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Zhang is the James and Patricia Poitras Professor of Neuroscience at MIT, an associate professor in the MIT departments of Brain and Cognitive Sciences and Biological Engineering, an investigator at the McGovern Institute for Brain Research, and a core member of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>New technology could lead to development of novel “xenoprotein” drugs against infectious diseases.</description>

 <guid isPermaLink="true">http://news.mit.edu/2018/chemists-synthesize-millions-proteins-not-found-nature-0521</guid>
<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MIT chemists have devised a way to rapidly synthesize and screen millions of novel proteins that could be used as drugs against Ebola and other viruses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All proteins produced by living cells are made from the 20 amino acids that are programmed by the genetic code. The MIT team came up with a way to assemble proteins from amino acids not used in nature, including many that are mirror images of natural amino acids.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These proteins, which the researchers call “xenoproteins,” offer many advantages over naturally occurring proteins. They are more stable, meaning that unlike most protein drugs, they don’t require refrigeration, and may not provoke an immune response.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There is no other technological platform that can be used to create these xenoproteins because people haven’t worked through the ability to use completely nonnatural sets of amino acids throughout the entire shape of the molecule,” says Brad Pentelute, an MIT associate professor of chemistry and the senior author of the paper, which appears in the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt; the week of May 21.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zachary Gates, an MIT postdoc, is the lead author of the paper. Timothy Jamison, head of MIT’s Department of Chemistry, and members of his lab also contributed to the paper.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nonnatural proteins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pentelute and Jamison launched this project four years ago, working with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which asked them to come up with a way to create molecules that mimic naturally occurring proteins but are made from nonnatural amino acids.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The mission was to generate discovery platforms that allow you to chemically manufacture large libraries of molecules that don’t exist in nature, and then sift through those libraries for the particular function that you desired,” Pentelute says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For this project, the research team built on technology that Pentelute’s lab had previously developed for &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.mit.edu/2017/automated-manufacturing-fast-peptide-synthesis-drugs-0227&quot;&gt;rapidly synthesizing protein chains&lt;/a&gt;. His tabletop machine can perform all of the chemical reactions needed to string together amino acids, synthesizing the desired proteins within minutes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As building blocks for their xenoproteins, the researchers used 16 “mirror-image” amino acids. Amino acids can exist in two different configurations, known as L and D. The L and D versions of a particular amino acid have the same chemical composition but are mirror images of each other. Cells use only L amino acids.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers then used synthetic chemistry to assemble tens of millions of proteins, each about 30 amino acids in length, all of the D configuration. These proteins all had a similar folded structure that is based on the shape of a naturally occurring protein known as a trypsin inhibitor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before this study, no research group had been able to create so many proteins made purely of nonnatural amino acids.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Significant effort has been devoted to development of methods for the incorporation of nonnatural amino acids into protein molecules, but these are generally limited with regard to the number of nonnatural amino acids that can simultaneously be incorporated into a protein molecule,” Gates says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After synthesizing the xenoproteins, the researchers screened them to identify proteins that would bind to an IgG antibody against an influenza virus surface protein. The antibodies were tagged with a fluorescent molecule and then mixed with the xenoproteins. Using a system called fluorescence-activated cell sorting, the researchers were able to isolate xenoproteins that bind to the fluorescent IgG molecule.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This screen, which can be done in only a few hours, revealed several xenoproteins that bind to the target. In other experiments, not published in the &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt; paper, the researchers have also identified xenoproteins that bind to anthrax toxin and to a glycoprotein produced by the Ebola virus. This work is in collaboration with John Dye, Spencer Stonier, and Christopher Cote at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is an extremely important first step in finding a good way of rapidly screening complex mirror image proteins,” says Stephen Kent, a professor of chemistry at the University of Chicago, who was not involved in the research. “Being able to use chemistry to make a library of mirror image proteins, with their high stability and specificity for a given target, is obviously of potential therapeutic interest.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Built on demand&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers are now working on synthesizing proteins modeled on different scaffold shapes, and they are searching for xenoproteins that bind to other potential drug targets. Their long-term goal is to use this system to rapidly synthesize and identify proteins that could be used to neutralize any type of emerging infectious disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The hope is that we can discover molecules in a rapid manner using this platform, and we can chemically manufacture them on demand. And after we make them, they can be shipped all over the place without refrigeration, for use in the field,” Pentelute says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to potential drugs, the researchers also hope to develop “xenozymes” — xenoproteins that can act as enzymes to catalyze novel types of chemical reactions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by DARPA and a STAR Postdoctoral Fellowship from Novo Nordisk.&lt;/p&gt;

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dozens of MIT undergraduate and graduate students unveiled the results of extensive research projects during the high-energy SuperUROP Showcase and Masterworks poster sessions at MIT’s Stata Center in late April.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Addressing topics as diverse as gene expression, smart-home sensing, aircraft propulsion, and theater promotion, about 130 participants in the Advanced Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program — better known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://superurop.mit.edu/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SuperUROP&lt;/a&gt; – presented the results of their yearlong projects in two shifts. Immediately following the SuperUROP sessions, nearly 50 master’s-degree recipients and candidates from the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) shared their own research results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s so satisfying to see the fruition of all this hard work,” said Anantha Chandrakasan, dean of the School of Engineering. “The diversity of projects is impressive, as is the level of rigor.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SuperUROP Showcase &lt;/strong&gt;&
00006000
lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Senior Nitah Onsongo, a computer science and engineering major (Course 6-3), for example, took advantage of the fact that, thanks to an anonymous donor, SuperUROP now &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.mit.edu/2018/cs-hass-superurop-debuts-nine-research-projects-0515&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;supports research involving the School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences&lt;/a&gt; (SHASS). Onsongo used machine learning, digital media, and web-development languages to create a tool designed to interest more people in theater. The experience left her an enthusiastic proponent of SuperUROP: “I really encourage everybody to enroll in this program sometime during their years here, because it’s helped me to practically apply my skills before going to industry.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;cms-placeholder-content-video&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Junior Stephanie Ren, also in 6-3, took a more traditional technical SuperUROP route. She developed a system that helps a smart-home sensing device keep track of people inside their houses, and she especially enjoyed the time she spent in the lab. “You’re working toward a problem no one has solved yet,” Ren said. “Doing that exploration is very different from taking classes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chandrakasan launched SuperUROP in EECS in 2012, when he was department head. The program expanded to the full School of Engineering in 2015 and to SHASS in 2017. SuperUROP provides students with an intensive graduate-level research experience supported by a two-term seminar, 6.UAR (Seminar in Undergraduate Advanced Research), that covers everything from designing experiments to presenting results. “It’s really a compressed version of life in research,” says Dirk Englund, an associate professor in EECS and an instructor for 6.UAR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year’s SuperUROP class includes students from the departments of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AeroAstro), Biological Engineering, Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE), and Chemical Engineering (ChemE), as well as EECS. Many received titles reflecting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://superurop.mit.edu/sponsors/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;industrial sponsors, foundations, and alumni donors&lt;/a&gt; whose contributions supported their research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2018 SuperUROP Showcase — which featured 66 big-screen electronic poster boards arrayed all along the Vest Student Street on the Stata Center’s first floor — attracted a steady stream of students, faculty, staff, alumni, and industry representatives. Audience members clustered around posters, giving participants a chance to present their work and answer questions in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s a great opportunity to develop professional presentation skills,” said senior Eric Wadkins (6-3), who described for visitors how he used techniques such as Bayesian inference to help a microscope learn where it is on a sample.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think the length of the SuperUROP is such that you can really get something done,” said Englund, who supervised Wadkins during the yearlong project and noted that the work has already led to a patent application. In Wadkins’ case, Englund said: “He’s given normal microscope a brain to make decisions on its own.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some who attended the event came because it offers an opportunity to get a sneak peek at the research taking place across the Institute. “It’s good to see technology in its earliest and rawest form,” said Jake Harrison, a technology scout for Samsung.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deborah Campbell, associate technology officer for MIT Lincoln Laboratory, praised the “exceptional quality and diversity” of the 2017-2018 SuperUROP projects. “It was clear that the students learned a lot and made significant contributions to the areas they worked in,” noted Campbell, whose organization sponsored 12 SuperUROP scholars this year. “They communicated this with clear and concise presentations, high-quality posters and demonstrations, and insightful answers to questions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten SuperUROP Scholars received audience-choice awards for their presentations, including Rene Garcia Franceschini of CEE, Erica Ding of ChemE, and Archis Bhandarkar, Nicholas Charchut, Sharlene Chiu, Emily Damato, Katy Muhlrad, Ryan Prinster, Jason Villanueva, and Larry Wang, all of EECS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faculty choices for the best SuperUROP Showcase posters will be announced later on the EECS website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Masterworks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Masterworks session, EECS master’s students presented the results of thesis research leading to the master of engineering and the master of science degree. Their projects addressed questions in fields ranging from health care to robotics to sustainable energy. As the SuperUROP scholars had, Masterworks participants engaged in lively discussions with attendees about their research approaches and results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the session, Englund, who co-directed Masterworks with fellow EECS Associate Professor Vinod Vaikuntanathan, presented three “audience-choice” awards for the best Masterworks posters. Rumen Hristov received first place for “Adding Identity to Device-Free Localization Systems in the Wild.” Second place went to Mazdak Abulnaga for “Visualizing the Placenta in a Familiar Way.” Third prize was awarded to Tathagata Srimani for “Energy Efficient Computing from Nanotubes to Negative Capacitance.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, Rumya Raghavan ’17 won the Masterworks Scavenger Hunt for correctly answering the most questions about research discussed on the posters. All four students received prizes provided by Masterworks sponsor Samsung.&lt;/p&gt;

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Abdul Latif Jameel World Education Lab (J-WEL) at MIT has selected 10 projects to receive grants as part of its program to support educational innovation. J-WEL grants support initiatives that impact MIT education, with the broad potential for impact in global settings. They are awarded bi-annually to MIT faculty, with spring and fall rounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grant recipients, pK-12 projects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;J-WEL Grants in pK-12 Education Innovation were awarded to the following projects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Teacher Practice Spaces for Equity Teaching Practices&quot; — Justin Reich, professor of comparative media studies/writing. Equity Teaching Practices are classroom strategies that counter the pernicious effects of structural inequality. Reich’s team will use their simulation platform, TeacherMoments, to help teachers from all disciplines, with particular emphasis on STEM fields, rehearse for and reflect on these practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Tailoring STEM for Girls with Social Impact: Curricula, Self-Efficacy Change and Factors of Success in Multi-Week Interventions&quot; — David Wallace, professor of mechanical engineering, and Larissa&amp;nbsp;Nietner, postdoc in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. To increase their participation in STEM, girls need to experience STEM content as socially impactful. This project will develop and test adequate curricula, materials, and generalizable principles, which can be shared and transferred between schools across both the U.S. and the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;High School Global STEM Project-Based Learning, Leveraging MIT BLOSSOMS&quot; — Richard Larson, the Mitsui Professor of Data, Systems, and Society, and Dan Frey, professor of mechanical engineering. This project will leverage MIT BLOSSOMS, a resource library where educators can find teaching materials, to create and evaluate compelling project-based learning (PBL) lesson plans for secondary-school STEM teachers and students. Working with MIT students and selected educational partners, the team will utilize existing BLOSSOMS lessons well-suited for PBL follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Compassionate Systems Framework and Network Development&quot; — Peter Senge and Mette Miriam Boell, J-WEL. In 2016, Peter Senge and Mette Miriam Boell began working with the international baccalaureate (IB) network to develop and prototype a “Compassionate Systems Framework,” connecting systems thinking with mindfulness practices and social-emotional learning across the pK-12 spectrum. In this project, their team will assess impact and identify best practices that can be extended beyond the IB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;XRoads: Building Educator Capacity in XR&quot; — Patty Maes, professor of media arts and sciences, and Eric Klopfer, professor of comparative media studies/writing. Virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR) — collectively known as “XR” — have great potential as educational tools, but few attempts have been made to integrate educators into the design and delivery of relevant experiences. Building upon their work in the Education Arcade and the MIT Media Lab&#039;s Fluid Interfaces group, research scientists Meredith Thompson and Scott W. Greenwald will work closely with teachers to adapt their work in room-scale VR for K-12 STEAM contexts and pilot the experiences with teachers and students.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Modular Curriculum With Hands-On, Low-Cost Biology Educational Activities&quot; — Jim Collins, the Termeer Professor of Medical Engineering and Science and professor of biological engineering. Collins and his team, led by biological engineering PhD student Ally Huang, previously&amp;nbsp;developed a hands-on, low-cost synthetic biology educational&amp;nbsp;kit based on&amp;nbsp;freeze-dried cell-free reactions, which demonstrate biological concepts in an&amp;nbsp;engaging manner. This project will develop a database of modular lessons using&amp;nbsp;these&amp;nbsp;activities, allowing educators to create their own curriculum suited for&amp;nbsp;their students’ needs.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grant recipients, higher education projects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The four higher education recipients for the spring 2018 grant round are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Technology Design for Coffee Production in Colombia: A Co-Design Experience&quot; — Dan Frey, professor of mechanical engineering. Frey, PhD student Pedro Reynolds-Cuéllar, and their team will develop an Independent Activities Period course for both graduate and undergraduate students from all five MIT schools. Students in the course will co-create or re-design, along with Colombian coffee farmers, technologies for different stages of the coffee production process in Colombia in the context of climate change adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Advancing Socially-Directed STEM Education&quot; —&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Christine Ortiz, the Morris Cohen Professor of Materials Science and Engineering. This project will focus on the development of course materials to be implemented in the MIT fall term class 3.087 (Materials, Societal Impact, and Social Innovation). The materials will not only be applied within MIT, but also to historically marginalized and underserved students nationwide and globally through a new nonprofit educational organization, Station1, founded by Ortiz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;&#039;Social IT Solutions&#039; Workshop in Tanzania&quot; — Lisa Parks, professor of comparative media studies. The “Social IT Solutions” workshop will equip computer science students at the Dar es Salaam Institute of Technology (DIT) and the State University of Zanzibar (SUZA) with interdisciplinary knowledge and skills in the areas of information communication technologies for development, digital media, and design learning. The MIT team, which will include four students, will work alongside faculty from DIT and SUZA to facilitate a two-week workshop for Tanzanian computer science students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Skicinuwi-npisun: A Community-Centered Project for Documentation and Teaching of the Passamaquoddy Language&quot; — Norvin Richards, professor of linguistics. This project supports the work of linguistics graduate student Newell Lewey, from the Passamaquoddy nation of northern Maine, to support language teaching and curriculum development to help preserve the severely endangered Passamaquoddy language. It also provides funds for MIT linguists to work with the remaining speakers of the language, both to help with the creation of pedagogical materials and to further understanding of the grammar of the language. Copies of all records and materials will be provided to the Passamaquoddy tribe, as well as being archived at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Seven MIT graduate students have been awarded 2018 National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ndsegfellowships.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NDSEG&lt;/a&gt;) Fellowships. They are among 69 fellows nationwide offered the highly competitive awards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NDSEG Fellowships last for up to three years, covering full tuition and mandatory fees. Fellows receive a monthly stipend of $3,200 and a yearly medical insurance stipend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fellows are selected by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, the Army Research Office and the Office of Naval Research. This year&#039;s NDSEG Fellows are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Eeshan Chetan Bhatt of the MIT/WHOI Joint Program in Oceanography and Applied Ocean Science and Engineering and the Department of Mechanical Engineering, funded by the Office of Naval Research;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Frederick Daso of the necstlab and the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, funded by the Office of Naval Research;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Ashley L. Kaiser of the necstlab and the Department of Materials Science and Engineering, funded by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Bharath Kannan of the Engineering Quantum Systems group and the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, funded by the Office of Naval Research;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Peter Yucheng Lu of the Photonics and Modern Electro-Magnetics Group and the Department of Physics, funded by the Army Research Office;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Molly Parsons of the Laboratory for Computational Biology and Biophysics and the Department of Biological Engineering, funded by the Office of Naval Research; and&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Sarah Schwartz of the Fournier Lab and the Department of Biology, funded by the Army Research Office.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“My experience as a 2016 Summer Scholar truly launched my career at MIT even before I returned for graduate school, and it allowed me the key opportunity to pursue and publish my research at a fast pace,” says Kaiser, who worked with Postdoc Itai Y. Stein to create&amp;nbsp;&lt;a dir=&quot;ltr&quot; href=&quot;http://news.mit.edu/2018/getting-heart-carbon-nanotube-clusters-0214&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;predictable patterns&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;from unpredictable carbon nanotubes. “I&#039;m very honored and excited to receive this fellowship, as it will support my research goals to develop enhanced nanocomposite technology during my PhD.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Winning this award was a culmination of two things: my growing passion for structural analysis as a freshman entering MIT, and Professor [Brian] Wardle&#039;s willingness to take on a freshman UROP into his lab group,” adds Daso, whose current research focuses on applying novel curing techniques to process thermoplastic composite materials and reducing or eliminating process-driven deformations during the cure cycle for resin impregnated fabrics. “With Professor Wardle&#039;s guidance and support, I was able to cultivate my interests in composite research and focus on getting into graduate school. Winning the award in such a competitive year is a testament to the future impact my work will have in the field of composite materials.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Begun in 1989, NDSEG has awarded nearly 3,600 fellowships to U.S. citizens and nationals who pursue a doctoral degree in one of 15 supported disciplines at a U.S. institution. The NDSEG Fellowship is sponsored by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, the Army Research Office, and the Office of Naval Research under the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Four MIT faculty members have been elected to the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) in recognition of their “distinguished and continuing achievements in original research.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIT’s four new NAS members are: Amy Finkelstein, the John and Jennie S. MacDonald Professor of Economics; Mehran Kardar, the Francis Friedman Professor of Physics; Xiao-Gang Wen, the Cecil and Ida Green Professor of Physics; and Feng Zhang, the Patricia and James Poitras ’63 Professor in Neuroscience at MIT, associate professor of brain and cognitive sciences and of biological engineering, and member of the McGovern Institute for Brain Research and the Broad Institute&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The group was among 84 new members and 21 new foreign associates elected to the NAS. Membership in the NAS is one of the most significant honors given to academic researchers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amy Finkelstein&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finkelstein is the co-scientific director of J-PAL North America, the&amp;nbsp;co-director of the Public Economics Program at the National Bureau of Economic Research, a member of the Institute of Medicine and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a fellow of the Econometric Society.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She has received numerous awards and fellowships including the John Bates Clark Medal (2012), the American Society of Health Economists’ ASHEcon Medal (2014), a Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (2009), the American Economic Association’s Elaine Bennett Research Prize (2008) and a Sloan Research Fellowship (2007). She has also received awards for graduate student teaching (2012) and graduate student advising (2010) at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She is one of the two principal investigators for the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment, a randomized evaluation of the impact of extending Medicaid coverage to low income, uninsured adults.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mehran Kardar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kardar obtained a BA from Cambridge University in 1979 and a PhD in physics from MIT in 1983. He was a junior fellow of the Harvard Society of Fellows from 1983 to 1986 before returning to MIT as an assistant professor, and was promoted to full professor in 1996. He has been a visiting professor at a number of institutions including Catholic University in Belgium, Oxford University, the University of California at Santa Barbara, the University of California at Berkeley, and Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His expertise is in statistical physics, and he has lectured extensively on this topic at MIT and in workshops at universities and institutes in France, the U.K., Switzerland, and Finland. He is the author of two books based on these lectures. In 2018 he was recognized by the American Association of Physics Teachers with the John David Jackson Excellence in Graduate Physics Education Award.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Calcium-based MRI sensor enables more sensitive brain imaging</title>

    <description>System detects direct signals of neural activity; could reveal patterns underlying behavior.</description>

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MIT neuroscientists have developed a new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sensor that allows them to monitor neural activity deep within the brain by tracking calcium ions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because calcium ions are directly linked to neuronal firing — unlike the changes in blood flow detected by other types of MRI, which provide an indirect signal — this new type of sensing could allow researchers to link specific brain functions to their pattern of neuron activity, and to determine how distant brain regions communicate with each other during particular tasks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Concentrations of calcium ions are closely correlated with signaling events in the nervous system,” says Alan Jasanoff, an MIT professor of biological engineering, brain and cognitive sciences, and nuclear science and engineering, an associate member of MIT’s McGovern Institute for Brain Research, and the senior author of the study. “We designed a probe with a molecular architecture that can sense relatively subtle changes in extracellular calcium that are correlated with neural activity.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In tests in rats, the researchers showed that their calcium sensor can accurately detect changes in neural activity induced by chemical or electrical stimulation, deep within a part of the brain called the striatum.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;MIT research associates Satoshi Okada and Benjamin Bartelle are the lead authors of the study, which appears in the April 30 issue of &lt;em&gt;Nature Nanotechnology&lt;/em&gt;. Other authors include professor of brain and cognitive sciences and Picower Institute for Learning and Memory member Mriganka Sur, Research Associate Nan Li, postdoc Vincent Breton-Provencher, former postdoc Elisenda Rodriguez, Wellesley College undergraduate Jiyoung Lee, and high school student James Melican.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tracking calcium&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A mainstay of neuroscience research, MRI allows scientists to identify parts of the brain that are active during particular tasks. The most commonly used type, known as functional MRI, measures blood flow in the brain as an indirect marker of neural activity. Jasanoff and his colleagues wanted to devise a way to map patterns of neural activity with specificity and resolution that blood-flow-based MRI techniques can’t achieve.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Methods that are able to map brain activity in deep tissue rely on changes in blood flow, and those are coupled to neural activity through many different physiological pathways,” Jasanoff says. “As a result, the signal you see in the end is often difficult to attribute to any particular underlying cause.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Calcium ion flow, on the other hand, can be directly linked with neuron activity. When a neuron fires an electrical impulse, calcium ions rush into the cell. For about a decade, neuroscientists have been using fluorescent molecules to label calcium in the brain and image it with traditional microscopy. This technique allows them to precisely track neuron activity, but its use is limited to small areas of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The MIT team set out to find a way to image calcium using MRI, which enables much larger tissue volumes to be analyzed. To do that, they designed a new sensor that can detect subtle changes in calcium concentrations outside of cells and respond in a way that can be detected with MRI.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new sensor consists of two types of particles that cluster together in the presence of calcium. One is a naturally occurring calcium-binding protein called synaptotagmin, and the other is a magnetic iron oxide nanoparticle coated in a lipid that can also bind to synaptotagmin, but only when calcium is present.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Calcium binding induces these particles to clump together, making them appear darker in an MRI image. High levels of calcium outside the neurons correlate with low neuron activity; when calcium concentrations drop, it means neurons in that area are firing electrical impulses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Detecting brain activity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To test the sensors, the researchers injected them into the striatum of rats, a region that is involved in planning movement and learning new behaviors. They then gave the rats a chemical stimulus that induces short bouts of neural activity, and found that the calcium sensor reflected this activity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They also found that the sensor picked up activity induced by electrical stimulation in a part of the brain involved in reward.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This approach provides a novel way to examine brain function, says Xin Yu, a research group leader at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics in Tuebingen, Germany, who was not involved in the research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Although we have accumulated sufficient knowledge on intracellular calcium signaling in the past half-century, it has seldom been studied exactly how the dynamic changes in extracellular calcium contribute to brain function, or serve as an indicator of brain function,” Yu says. “When we are deciphering such a complicated and self-adapted system like the brain, every piece of information matters.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The current version of the sensor responds within a few seconds of the initial brain stimulation, but the researchers are working on speeding that up. They are also trying to modify the sensor so that it can spread throughout a larger region of the brain and pass through the blood-brain barrier, which would make it possible to deliver the particles without injecting them directly to the test site.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With this kind of sensor, Jasanoff hopes to map patterns of neural activity with greater precision than is now possible. “You could imagine measuring calcium activity in different parts of the brain and trying to determine, for instance, how different types of sensory stimuli are encoded in different ways by the spatial pattern of neural activity that they induce,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the MIT Simons Center for the Social Brain.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Brad Pentelute: In search of novel proteins</title>

    <description>Chemistry professor builds on nature to design new drugs and engineer better ways to deliver them.</description>

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Scientists who want to treat disease by delivering large proteins such as antibodies or enzymes to cells have struggled to overcome one major bottleneck: getting the proteins to cross cell membranes so they can enter the target cells. In the search for new ways to deliver such drugs, MIT associate professor of chemistry Brad Pentelute has turned to an unlikely ally — the anthrax toxin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The bacterium &lt;em&gt;Bacillus anthracis&lt;/em&gt; has very efficient machinery for penetrating cell membranes and injecting toxic proteins into cells. Pentelute, who has studied this process since his years as a postdoc at Harvard Medical School, decided to enlist this toxin, which he renders harmless by modifying two of the three proteins that form the toxin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We disarm it and remove all of its toxic functionality, but still maintain the delivery mechanism. Then we hijack that system to deliver proteins, peptides, and other molecules into specific cell types,” Pentelute says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using this and other innovative approaches to crossing cell membranes, Pentelute hopes to devise new ways to deliver not only large proteins but also nucleic acids such as RNA and DNA, which could be used to correct genetic mutations or reduce expression of a disease-causing gene. His lab also designs novel proteins that could be utilized to treat disease, using a variety of chemical modifications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re a lab that really tries to use chemistry to solve problems in biotechnology,” he says. “We can use a variety of techniques to change the chemistry of these proteins so they have different structures and functionalities.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unexpected discoveries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A native of San Diego, Pentelute began his undergraduate career at the University of Southern California as a psychology major. However, after taking some chemistry courses, he decided to add a chemistry major and began working in an organometallic chemistry lab. After graduating from USC, he went to the University of Chicago to study bioorganic chemistry, a field that employs chemical methods to study biological phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a graduate student, Pentelute studied a subset of proteins called antifreeze proteins, which inhibit ice formation and help organisms such as the snow flea survive in subfreezing temperatures. At the time, no one had discovered the structure of these proteins, but Pentelute found a way to crystallize them so that he could use X-ray crystallography to analyze their structure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In doing so, he made an unexpected discovery. Amino acids, the building blocks of proteins, can exist in two different configurations, known as L and D. The L and D versions of a particular amino acid have the same chemical composition but are mirror images of each other. Cells use only proteins made from L amino acids, but Pentelute found that if he synthesized the L and D configurations of the antifreeze protein, the resulting mixture was much more likely to crystallize.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In some cases, proteins are difficult to crystallize, so we found a little bit of a trick: If you could chemically synthesize the mirror image form, then you’re more likely to get crystal formation than if you have the pure L form alone, just because of the packing considerations of how the crystal can form,” Pentelute says. “That turned out to be a fun, unexpected path of the research program.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After finishing his PhD, Pentelute joined a startup company that was designing new peptides for treating diabetes. During the nine months he spent there, he decided that academic research was a better fit for him. “I realized I had a passion for academic-based research, where you have the freedom to do basic science, and when unexpected discoveries come up you can pursue them,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seeking solutions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pentelute returned to the academic world as a postdoc at Harvard Medical School, where he first began working on the anthrax toxin. Working with John Collier, Pentelute helped to discover how the anthrax toxin is able to penetrate cell membranes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since joining the MIT faculty in 2011, Pentelute has continued working on anthrax, hoping to develop it as a possible vehicle for delivering drugs across not only cell membranes but also the blood-brain barrier. This barrier, which separates circulating blood from the brain, makes it very difficult to deliver drugs to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pentelute’s lab is also developing novel proteins not found in nature, by stringing together amino acids of the D configuration, including some novel amino acids not used by cells. Using this approach, Pentelute and his students can create libraries of millions of proteins that they then screen for effectiveness against a range of diseases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To help with the large-scale protein production needed for all of these projects, Pentelute’s lab has also invented a new tabletop machine that can string together amino acids using chemistry, to synthesize the desired proteins within minutes. He recently launched a company called Amide Technologies, located in Kendall Square, that is working toward commercializing the peptide synthesis technology.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Being in such close proximity to the biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies surrounding MIT is one of the major features that drew Pentelute to the Institute.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“For people interested in biotech, MIT is like Disneyland,” he says. “You can walk across the street and talk to the world leaders in the development of antibody-based therapeutics, or you can go down the street and talk to other people that are really excited about delivery of oligonucleotides into cells, and other kinds of therapeutics.”&lt;/p&gt;

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Center for Environmental Health Sciences (CEHS) at MIT held its annual poster session on April 10 in the lobby of Building 13. The session highlighted the work of the environmental health research communities of MIT and some of its peer institutions. Over 50 posters were presented from the science and engineering laboratories affiliated with CEHS, the MIT Superfund Research Program, and the Department of Biological Engineering. As an experiment, this year the new MIT Superfund Research Program joined with CEHS in the poster session. The national Superfund program focuses on chemicals and local environments that are the most heavily contaminated by environmental pollution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The CEHS has an overall mission to study the biological effects of exposure to environmental agents in order to understand, and predict, how such exposures affect human health. Moreover, by uncovering the chemical, biochemical, and genetic bases for environmental disease, sometimes researchers are able to leverage that understanding to delay or even prevent the development of disease in human populations. To that end, the center brings together 44 MIT members from a total of 11 MIT departments (in both the School of Science and the School of Engineering) plus one faculty member from the Broad Institute.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This year’s CEHS cash prizes are awarded in two categories, graduate students and postdocs. For each category, the prize for first-place is $1,000, second-place prize is $500, and the third-place prize is $200 plus CEHS memorabilia. The cash prizes were made possible by the Myriam Marcelle Znaty Research Fund, which was established over 30 years ago to support the research of young scientists at MIT.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Undergraduate and graduate students, postdocs, and research staff presented the results of their research at MIT&#039;s Building 13.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anna I. Ponomarenko from Professor Matthew Shoulders’ lab won first place in the graduate student category. Ponomarenko presented her work on the “Host Chaperones Potentiate a Pathogenic Influenza Nucleoprotein Variant.” She shared this prize with her co-authors, Angela Phillips and Kenny Chen. In second place is George L. Sun from Professor Angela Belcher’s lab, who presented his work on “Using Yeast to Remediate Heavy Metals from Contaminated Waters and Soils.” Third place went to Lauren Stopfer, from Professor Forest White’s lab; Stopfer presented her work on “Treatment-Modulated Antigens: A Quantitative Approach to Identify Changes in MHC Peptide Repertoires.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the postdoc category, first place went to Helene Angot from Professor Noelle Selin’s lab, who presented on “Toxic Pollutants: From Worldwide Atmospheric Emissions to Impacts on Maine Tribal Areas.” Angot’s poster is also a joint Superfund Research Program poster. Second place went to Ben Crawford, from Professor Jesse Kroll’s lab, who presented his work on “Building a Low-Cost, Community-based Sensor Network in Hawai’i to Measure Volcanic Air Pollution.” And the third place prize went to Mary Andorfer, from Professor Catherine Drennan’s lab, who presented her work on “Taming Radical Enzymes through Directed Evolution and Structural Analysis.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Growing global food demand, climate change, and climate policies favoring bioenergy production are expected to increase pressures on water resources around the world. Many analysts predict that water shortages will constrain the ability of farmers to expand irrigated cropland, which would be critical to ramping up production of both food and bioenergy crops. If true, bioenergy production and food consumption would decline amid rising food prices and pressures to convert forests to rain-fed farmland. Now a team of researchers at the MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change has put this prediction to the test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To assess the likely impacts of future limited water resources on bioenergy production, food consumption and prices, land-use change and the global economy, the MIT researchers have conducted a study that explicitly represents irrigated land and water scarcity. Appearing in the &lt;em&gt;Australian Journal of Agriculture and Resource Economics,&lt;/em&gt; the study is the first to include an estimation of how irrigation management and systems may respond to changes in water availability in a global economy-wide model that represents agriculture, energy and land-use change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combining the MIT Integrated Global System Modeling (&lt;a href=&quot;https://owa.exchange.mit.edu/owa/redir.aspx?C=xFE-aTiJNs-bUX09WfovVoadNS52yo2Mere-vyCOKKNt7iOKqIzVCA..&amp;amp;URL=https%3a%2f%2fglobalchange.mit.edu%2fresearch%2fresearch-tools%2fglobal-framework&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;IGSM&lt;/a&gt;) framework with a water resource system (WRS) component that enables analyses at the scale of river basins, the model represents additional irrigable land in 282 river basins across the globe. Using the IGSM-WRS model, the researchers assessed the costs of expanding production in these areas through upgrades such as improving irrigation efficiency, lining canals to limit water loss, and expanding water storage capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They found that explicitly representing irrigated land (i.e., distinguishing it from rain-fed land, which produces lower yields) had little impact on their projections of global food consumption and prices, bioenergy production, and the rate of deforestation under water scarcity. The impacts are minimal because in response to shortages, water can be used more efficiently through the aforementioned upgrades, and regions with relatively less water scarcity can expand agricultural production for export to more arid regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the researchers determined that changes in water availability for agriculture of plus or minus 20 percent had little impact on global food prices, bioenergy production, land-use change and the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Many previous economy-wide studies do not include a representations of water constraints, and those that do fail to consider changes in irrigation systems (e.g. construction of more dams or improvements in irrigation efficiency) in response to water shortages,” says MIT Joint Program Principal Research Scientist &lt;a href=&quot;https://globalchange.mit.edu/about-us/personnel/winchester-niven&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Niven Winchester&lt;/a&gt;, the study’s lead author. “When these responses are included, we find that water shortages have smaller impacts than estimated in other studies.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the small global impacts, the researchers observed that explicitly representing irrigated land under water scarcity as well as changes in water availability for agriculture can have significant impact at the regional level. In places where rainfall is relatively low and/or population growth is projected to outpace irrigation capacity and efficiency improvements, water shortages are more likely to limit irrigated cropland expansion, leading to lower crop production in those areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study’s findings highlight the importance of improvements in irrigation efficiency and international trade in agricultural commodities. The research may also be used to identify regions with a high potential to be severely influenced by future water shortages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The study was primarily funded by BP.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Startup aims to democratize synthetic biology</title>

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MIT Media Lab spinout Amino Labs aims to bring synthetic biology to the world, with an all-in-one mini-lab kit that can be used in labs and classrooms, and even right at home.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Synthetic biology —&amp;nbsp;injecting microbes with different DNA programs to make them perform new functions —&amp;nbsp;has become an increasingly promising discipline. Research has yielded, for instance, viruses that attack harmful bacteria, yeasts that produce biofuels, and microbes capable of detecting environmental toxins. Companies are also engineering microorganisms to produce pigments, fragrances, and chemicals for consumer products.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Synthetic biology is a powerful technology that will transform humanity this century,” says Amino CEO Julie Legault SM ’15, a tech-savvy designer who co-founded the startup with Justin Pahara, a Cambridge University graduate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Amino recently launched its first commercial synthetic biology kits —&amp;nbsp;based largely on Legault’s Media Lab thesis research — that include all the necessary tools and materials for anyone, anywhere, to start experimenting with engineering microbes. Currently, the kits include bacteria that radiate different colors, but Amino is soon expanding to bacteria that emit scents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Amino currently offers two full kits: the entry-level DNA Playground, which comes with everything to program and grow bacteria on a petri dish, and the more advanced Bio Explorer, which includes the same basic equipment as well as a few additional tools and a liquid bacteria culture. “Users can extract the bacteria from the liquid culture to create pigment for a real product, such as paint,” Legault says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The kits — which cost $390 for Playground and around $1,700 for Explorer — are about one-tenth as expensive as purchasing the individual equipment, Legault says. Amino has sold about 250 full kits, so far, to teachers and students, parents and children, museums, makers, artists, and researchers. The startup is also hoping to bring the kits to students in developing countries and to researchers that operate in areas without access to full biology labs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Like following a recipe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Amino’s kits come with a machine, about the size of a shoe box, that contains a touchscreen thermostat and two temperature-based “stations” on the top. A cold station, which resembles a ventilation fan, reaches freezing temperatures to chill microbes or certain ingredients. The hot station, an indented circular plate, “heatshocks” the bacteria to allow the preprogrammed DNA to go through cell membranes. It also warms ingredients and incubates cells at various temperatures. Some machines come Wi-Fi-enabled, so users can track temperatures remotely and share their data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The kits also come with “wetware,” meaning the biological agents, such as the preprogrammed DNA, bacteria, and liquid buffers. To experiment, users basically take the DNA tube (blue cap), mix it with the buffer (red cap), and pour the solution onto a petri dish, or liquid culture, and stick it on the hot station. Included software walks users through the experiments and explains the science.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s very similar to following a cooking recipe,” Legault says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Users can order kits with 10 different colors: blue, blueberry blue, violet, orange, teal, purple, fluorescent cyan, fluorescent magenta, fluorescent yellow, and fluorescent raspberry red. This summer, kits will include fragrances, such as banana and mint, and may include 50 different colors and scents by the year’s end, Legault says. Amino also separately sells the individual wetware, bacteria-extraction tools, and even canvases for bacteria art.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other synthetic-biology kits exist. But those are designed primarily for classrooms and require knowledgeable teachers, Legault says. Amino’s kits —&amp;nbsp;which some media have dubbed the “Easy-Bake Oven” for biology —&amp;nbsp;are meant for the general public. That, of course, also benefits middle and high school teachers, who may not have the requisite knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In my high school, teachers would often get moved from gym class to science class and have to teach the material,” says Legault, who hails from Montreal. With Amino’s kits, “you don’t have to know the science or technology. You just have to know how to use a touchscreen.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The kits can also serve as a general platform for users to hack with their own DNA programs. Legault and Pahara are currently writing a book that walks users, step by step, through creating different DNA programs. By 2020, the startup hopes to offer more technologically advanced kits to these biohackers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are building out the kits’ capabilities, but we also don’t want to go too fast and scare away users,” Legault says. “The important thing for us is to let people know you can do synthetic biology with no prior knowledge.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal biology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For Legault, making synthetic biology more accessible was a personal journey. She came to the Media Lab in 2014 with a background in design and wearables — and practically no knowledge of synthetic biology.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But, during Legault’s first year, she helped Media Lab Director Joi Ito organize a biotech hackathon on campus that centered around the technologies of Synbiota, a startup developing software for managing biodiversity data, co-founded by Connor Dickie SM ’07 and Pahara, her future Amino Labs co-founder.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During that two-weekend hackathon, Legault created a DNA program for bacteria to create an anticancer agent, “but which also produced a really nice purple color,” Legault says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That experience, creating pigment from living cells, inspired Legault to delve into the rather obscure subject of synthetic biology. “Biology was something in high school, where we dissected frogs but never created anything inspiring,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That fall, she reserved space in an MIT biology lab. But the lab was a long walk away, and she found herself working alongside students conducting cancer research or handling hazardous materials. “I was just trying to engineer cells to glow in the dark, which is the most basic thing to do,” she says. “It was a bit of a nightmare.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To make things more comfortable, Legault designed a portable minilab. Using her engineering chops, she created miniaturized versions of a culturing bioreactor, a heating and cooling station, and a microbe incubator. The lab’s design would then become the subject of her thesis project, which she calls, “the domestication of biotechnology.” The idea was inspired, in part, by Tamagotchi, the electronic device that lets users feed and care for a virtual pet. “You’d grow bacteria and inject it with different sugars to see how it could react, bringing a playful, nurturing aspect to science experiments,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At first, Legault had no interest in commercialization. When she presented the minilab at conferences around Boston, however, people began asking to buy them. That year, she took the idea to Media Lab’s E14 Fund, which provides stipends, mentoring, networking, and basic legal and accounting services to student entrepreneurs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Entrepreneurship wasn’t a route I was looking to get into, but there was demand and interest, and the E14 Fund offered a low-risk way to test if anyone wanted the kit,” she says. “That was really valuable at that point.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pahara, who was then developing wetware for Synbiota, joined Legault. In 2015, the two, along with contracted engineers, built a prototype kit and hosted workshops at, among other venues, the Cambridge Science Festival, the MIT Museum, and local middle schools and high schools. Two years of testing and refining led to Amino’s two current commercial kits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Today, Amino, headquartered in Alberta, Canada, is gaining traction, having delivered kits to 21 countries, to schools and at-home learners. The startup is currently in talks with the Zhejiang Association for Science and Technology (ZAST) in China to expand into the Chinese market and open an office there. The startup would introduce kits to classrooms, so students can develop basic skills, and educate the public about synthetic biology’s potential to, for instance, help treat disease and alleviate world hunger. “China realizes the potential of synthetic biology and is hungry to bring innovation to the country,” Legault says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The startup also has plans to bring the kits to Africa — for students, but also for researchers. “In much of Africa, there aren’t research labs for African scientists or people going there to solve problems, such as curing diseases,” Legault says. “Our kits could be used by researchers in the field for research and development or diagnostics.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eight MIT faculty members are among 213 leaders from academia, business, public affairs, the humanities, and the arts elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the academy announced today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the nation’s most prestigious honorary societies, the academy is also a leading center for independent policy research. Members contribute to academy publications, as well as studies of science and technology policy, energy and global security, social policy and American institutions, the humanities and culture, and education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those elected from MIT this year are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Alexei Borodin, professor of mathematics;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Gang Chen, the Carl Richard Soderberg Professor of Power Engineering and head of the Department of Mechanical Engineering;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Larry D. Guth; professor of mathematics;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Parag A. Pathak, the Jane Berkowitz Carlton and Dennis William Carlton Professor of Microeconomics;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Nancy L. Rose, the Charles P. Kindleberger Professor of Applied Economics and head of the Department of Economics;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Leigh H. Royden, professor of earth, atmostpheric, and planetary sciences;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Sara Seager, the Class of 1941 Professor in the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences with a joint appointment in the Department of Physics; and&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Feng Zhang, the James and Patricia Poitras Professor of Neuroscience within the departments of Brain and Cognitive Sciences and Biological Engineering, and an &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;investigator&lt;/span&gt; at the &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This class of 2018 is a testament to the academy’s ability to both uphold our 238-year commitment to honor exceptional individuals and to recognize new expertise,” said Nancy C. Andrews, chair of the board of the American Academy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Membership in the academy is not only an honor, but also an opportunity and a responsibility,” added Jonathan Fanton, president of the American Academy. “Members can be inspired and engaged by connecting with one another and through academy projects dedicated to the common good. The intellect, creativity, and commitment of the 2018 class will enrich the work of the academy and the world in which we live.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new class will be inducted at a ceremony in October in Cambridge, Massachusetts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since its founding in 1780, the academy has elected leading “thinkers and doers” from each generation, including George Washington and Benjamin Franklin in the 18th century, Maria Mitchell and Daniel Webster in the 19th century, and Toni Morrison and Albert Einstein in the 20th century. The current membership includes more than 200 Nobel laureates and 100 Pulitzer Prize winners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;During the past several years, many strains of bacteria have become resistant to existing antibiotics, and very few new drugs have been added to the antibiotic arsenal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To help combat this growing public health problem, some scientists are exploring antimicrobial peptides — naturally occurring peptides found in most organisms. Most of these are not powerful enough to fight off infections in humans, so researchers are trying to come up with new, more potent versions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers at MIT and the Catholic University of Brasilia have now developed a streamlined approach to developing such drugs. Their new strategy, which relies on a computer algorithm that mimics the natural process of evolution, has already yielded one potential drug candidate that successfully killed bacteria in mice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We can use computers to do a lot of the work for us, as a discovery tool of new antimicrobial peptide sequences,” says Cesar de la Fuente-Nunez, an MIT postdoc and Areces Foundation Fellow. “This computational approach is much more cost-effective and much more time-effective.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;De la Fuente-Nunez and Octavio Franco of the Catholic University of Brasilia and the Dom Bosco Catholic University are the corresponding authors of the paper, which appears in the April 16 issue of &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;. Timothy Lu, an MIT associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science, and of biological engineering, is also an author.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Artificial peptides&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Antimicrobial peptides kill microbes in many different ways. They enter microbial cells by damaging their membranes, and once inside, they can disrupt cellular targets such as DNA, RNA, and proteins.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In their search for more powerful, artificial antimicrobial peptides, scientists typically synthesize hundreds of new variants, which is a laborious and time-consuming process, and then test them against different types of bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;De la Fuente-Nunez and his colleagues wanted to find a way to make computers do most of the design work. To achieve that, the researchers created a computer algorithm that incorporates the same principles as Darwin’s theory of natural selection. The algorithm can start with any peptide sequence, generate thousands of variants, and test them for the desired traits that the researchers have specified.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“By using this approach, we were able to explore many, many more peptides than if we had done this manually. Then we only had to screen a tiny fraction of the entirety of the sequences that the computer was able to browse through,” de la Fuente-Nunez says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this study, the researchers began with an antimicrobial peptide found in the seeds of the guava plant. This pe
00006000
ptide, known as Pg-AMP1, has only weak antimicrobial activity. The researchers told the algorithm to come up with peptide sequences with two features that help peptides to penetrate bacterial membranes: a tendency to form alpha helices and a certain level of hydrophobicity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After the algorithm generated and evaluated tens of thousands of peptide sequences, the researchers synthesized the most promising 100 candidates to test against bacteria grown in lab dishes. The top performer, known as guavanin 2, contains 20 amino acids. Unlike the original Pg-AMP1 peptide, which is rich in the amino acid glycine, guavanin is rich in arginine but has only one glycine molecule.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More powerful&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These differences make guavanin 2 much more potent, especially against a type of bacteria known as Gram-negative. Gram-negative bacteria include many species responsible for the most common hospital-acquired infections, including pneumonia and urinary tract infections.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers tested guavanin 2 in mice with a skin infection caused by a type of Gram-negative bacteria known as &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;, and found that it cleared the infections much more effectively than the original Pg-AMP1 peptide.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This work is important because new types of antibiotics are needed to overcome the growing problem of antibiotic resistance,” says Mikhail Shapiro, an assistant professor of chemical engineering at Caltech, who was not involved in the study. “The authors take an innovative approach to this problem by computationally designing antimicrobial peptides using an&amp;nbsp;‘in silico’&amp;nbsp;evolutionary algorithm, which scores new peptides based on a set of properties known to be correlated with effectiveness. They also include an impressive array of experiments to show that the resulting peptides indeed have the properties needed to serve as antibiotics, and that they work in at least one mouse model of infections.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;De la Fuente-Nunez and his colleagues now plan to further develop guavanin 2 for potential human use, and they also plan to use their algorithm to seek other potent antimicrobial peptides. There are currently no artificial antimicrobial peptides approved for use in human patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“A &lt;a href=&quot;https://amr-review.org/sites/default/files/AMR%20Review%20Paper%20-%20Tackling%20a%20crisis%20for%20the%20health%20and%20wealth%20of%20nations_1.pdf&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; commissioned by the British government estimates that antibiotic-resistant bacteria will kill 10 million people per year by the year 2050, so coming up with new methods to generate antimicrobials is of huge interest, both from a scientific perspective and also from a global health perspective,” de la Fuente-Nunez says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by the Ramón Areces Foundation and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA).&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>MIT senior and varsity softball co-captain brings positivity and determination to life-saving biology research.</description>
     <pubDate>Mon, 09 Apr 2018 23:59:59 -0400</pubDate>

 <guid isPermaLink="true">http://news.mit.edu/2018/student-profile-jasmin-joseph-0410</guid>
<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;During her sophomore year, biological engineering major Jasmin Joseph needed her wisdom teeth removed. Her softball coach drove Joseph to and from her appointment and left her with one instruction: Don’t come to practice today.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But Joseph, a Woodland Hills, California, native who had played softball since the age of 13, was determined not to miss practice. She showed up anyway, and though not allowed to play, happily watched her teammates from the bench. Her dedication was no surprise to those who know her: Joseph, now a senior, has brought that same determination to all her activities, both academic and service-based.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During high school, Joseph developed a deep fascination with biology — specifically how it could be used to develop life-saving treatments for rare diseases. During an AP biology class, she watched “Lorenzo’s Oil,” a 1992 retelling of the real-life story of a family’s quest to develop a treatment for their son’s adrenoleukodystrophy, which causes damage to the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I just remember thinking that it was super cool that they could actually correct for a disease,” Joseph says. She realized she wanted to help develop those types of treatments, but she wasn’t sure what she’d have to study to accomplish that. Then she spoke with a teacher who had a background in genetic engineering. After learning more about synthetic biology, Joseph had found her match: biological engineering. With that goal in mind, Joseph began to look at different schools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The thing that drew me to [biological engineering] in the first place was being able to help people,” Joseph says, “and [MIT] was the only school where I felt that goal was actually true of the curriculum.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global researcher&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During her time at MIT, Joseph has taken part in research and volunteer opportunities around the world. After her first year, Joseph worked as an undergraduate researcher at the National University of Singapore and performed vaccine delivery research through the Singapore-MIT Undergraduate Research Fellowship. Her research focused on delivering vaccines for mosquito-borne viruses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I would see advertisements and posters on the train for dengue studies looking for participants, and warnings not to leave standing water nearby because it attracts mosquitoes that could carry the virus,” Joseph recalls. “It was a real reminder of the need this sort of research fills and how imperative it is to work toward bettering global access to vaccines and treatments for infectious diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The following summer, Joseph traveled to Ghana to work as a development volunteer at MoringaConnect, a startup &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.mit.edu/2014/doing-more&quot;&gt;founded by Kwami Williams ’12&lt;/a&gt;. The startup centers around finding efficient and sustainable ways to process the moringa plant, which has nutritional and medicinal properties, so that community members may begin to grow it, process it, and sell it themselves. Joseph helped improve methods to process the moringa leaf. While doing her research, she found time to share her vibrant personality with other volunteers and community members. “Every Monday, someone had to teach a lesson, and I taught how to juggle,” Joseph recalls with a laugh.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The summer before her senior year, Joseph worked as an undergraduate researcher at the University of Cape Town, through the MIT International Science and Technology Initiatives (MISTI) MIT-South Africa program, and worked on cancer drug development. “I hopped onto different projects while I was there and learned a lot,” Joseph says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While at MIT, Joseph has also developed her knowledge of public health. During the Independent Activities Period (IAP) of here sophomore year, Joseph taught health and biology to high school students in Puebla, Mexico, through MISTI’s Global Teaching Labs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During IAP of her senior year, Joseph took HST.434 (“Evolution of an Epidemic). The class took place in Durban, South Africa, and focused on the evolution of the AIDS epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There, Joseph learned about the FRESH study, a long-term study that identifies women acutely infected by HIV. The study, run by the Ragon Institute of Harvard, MGH, and MIT, also provides those women with career training and aims to empower them through education. Joseph was deeply inspired by the women participating in the study project.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Even though they’re living in a place where HIV is prevalent and they have to face so many hardships in their lives, they are still so vibrant and lively, and I really felt that they had found a sisterhood,” Joseph says, “I thought it was really cool to see them leaning on each other. It really helped me to see that I love the idea of having an impact on global health.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making smiles &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During her sophomore year, Joseph joined Camp Kesem, a summer camp for children whose parents have been affected by cancer. As part of training, Joseph learned camp songs and games which she could play with the campers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You go to camp for a week, and you’re just there to make the kids smile and be their friend. That’s all it is and all it should be, and it’s great,” Joseph says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After her first week volunteering at Camp Kesem, Joseph applied for the coordinator board to play a bigger role in planning camp activities. “I got on the coordinator board and I just threw myself into it completely, I loved it so much, and I still do,” Joseph says. She focused especially on teen activities. “In addition to the normal camp things, we also do leadership development and get into deeper, more emotional conversations with [teens],” Joseph says. “You get to be there for them.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This year, Joseph is the volunteer coordinator for Camp Kesem and helps find the next groups of counselors for the coming summers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These people are going to be the next people with our campers, and they’re going to be helping find the next generation and the next generation. It’s been really fun. I found a lot of great friends through Camp Kesem, and there’s just so many incredible people in it,” Joseph says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding family through sport&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When she’s not in the classroom or in a lab across the world, Joseph can be found with her softball team. Joseph has played varsity softball since her first year at MIT, and considers the team her family.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s like we’re getting through everything together and it feels seamless,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Joseph says the team spends a lot of time together in the locker room, building friendships and supporting one another. “I think it is really a testament to how much our coaches put into fostering the sort of community where everyone can be themselves and really embrace who they are as softball players and friends and people,” Joseph says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After graduation, Joseph intends to get her PhD in biological engineering; she also plans to be a writer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Long term, it’s about being able to take what I learned and share it and make sure that people have access to the information that they need to be able to make the decisions that are the best for them and the people they care about,” Joseph says. “I like the idea of writing and communicating the things that are important to the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;“Close your eyes and think about a scientist that is building a time machine,” said &lt;a href=&quot;http://eapsweb.mit.edu/people/kdberg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kristin Bergmann&lt;/a&gt;. “What does your scientist look like? What does the time machine look like? Now open your eyes and I will show you my time machine.” Bergmann reveals a pair of hiking boots and a picture of her standing on a cliff face looking at ancient rocks deposited there by an ocean to an audience at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mitmuseum.mit.edu/program/girls-day&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MIT Museum’s Girls Day&lt;/a&gt;. “With these boots, I travel back in time. Raise your hand if I am the scientist you were imagining and this is the time machine that I was building.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bergmann, the Victor P. Starr Career Development assistant professor in MIT’s Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences (&lt;a href=&quot;http://eapsweb.mit.edu/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;EAPS&lt;/a&gt;), was one of many environmental scientists from the department who joined other groups from MIT, Harvard University, Northeastern University, and Boston University participating in the MIT Museum’s Girls Day on March 10, encouraging girls and women to become scientists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now in its sixth year, the biannual event held in March and November celebrates women in the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields and demonstrates diversity in science among the people involved and their career choices. It also helps to combat the U.S. gender gap in science by inspiring girls to pursue STEM professions. The Girls Day theme changes each time, and this month, 823 guests came out to explore environmental science by listening to talks from EAPS scientists and a freelance science writer, as well as participating in 18 hands-on activities. Members from within EAPS joined the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wixii.scripts.mit.edu/wixii/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MIT Women in Course 12&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sustain.scripts.mit.edu/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MIT Undergraduate Association of Sustainability&lt;/a&gt;, MIT Museum Teen Programming Council,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://be.mit.edu/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MIT Department of Biological Engineering&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wga3.mit.edu/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MIT Women’s Graduate Association of Aeronautics and Astronautics&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://swe.mit.edu/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MIT Society of Women Engineers&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to investigate topics including geology, paleoclimatology, gemstone identification and topological maps; ocean physics, ecosystems and pollution; and atmospheric dynamics and viewing the Earth from space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enthusiastic talks from MIT women in science set the tone for the day. After&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linkedin.com/in/greta-friar/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Greta Friar&lt;/a&gt; SM &#039;17, a graduate of the MIT science writing program and a freelancer, kicked off the morning session,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://eapsweb.mit.edu/people/mlickley&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Megan Lickley&lt;/a&gt; was next to speak. As a third-year graduate student in EAPS&#039; Program in Atmospheres, Oceans and Climate (&lt;a href=&quot;http://paocweb.mit.edu/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PAOC&lt;/a&gt;) and an occasional participant in Joint Program in the Science and Policy of Global Change work, Lickley spends her time modeling climate change-related sea-level rise, how it’s measured, and its costs. During her talk, Lickley explored causes for this rise particularly in Boston, where these young girls and women call home. She looked at ice melt, thermal expansion, sinking lands, ice sheet fingerprints, and ocean dynamics in around the world and asked the audience to hypothesize why Boston might be experiencing sea-level rise more than other locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Lickley’s path into the study of sea level rise took a meandering route, she’s glad that she’s found it and can share her passion with others. “It took me a several years to figure out how I wanted to work on the climate change problem.&amp;nbsp;I tried various other things and I hoped to convey [at Girls Day] that there is value to exploring before deciding on a career. I love my work,” and, “I think it’s important for girls to see women who love their jobs.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike Lickley,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://eapsweb.mit.edu/people/sistiaga&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ainara Sistiaga&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;knew from a young age that she wanted to study archaeology, inspired by a history book given to her by her mother exploring how people in Egypt lived in the past. Now, Sistiaga, the Marie Curie Postdoctoral Fellow at MIT and the University of Copenhagen working in the Summons Lab, investigates human evolution through paleolithic&amp;nbsp;archaeology and organic chemistry. Growing up, movies often depicted archaeology as a dangerous field suited for strong men like Indiana Jones, but then Sistiaga learned of Mary Leakey’s research, tracing the origins of&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;back to the great apes. If Leakey could do it, why couldn’t she? Sistiaga travels the globe collecting and analyzing fecal samples from Neanderthals, mummies, and modern populations to investigate the role of diet and the gut microbiome in human evolution. She hopes to learn more about environmental pressures our ancestors faced and why the Neanderthals died out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kristin Bergmann’s hiking boots “time machine” take her to far reaches of the globe, back to an age long before Neanderthals. As a geobiologist, she’s trying to figure out why the Earth is special: Why did it take about 3 billion years for life to transition from small, simple microbes to large complex animals? For this, she turns to rocks. “Rocks capture secrets about the history of our planet and the life that has lived on it,” Bergmann told an attentive audience. Her work has focused on marine carbonate sedimentary rocks and fossils, analyzing them in the field and the lab in order to better understand how the chemistry and climate of the oceans and atmosphere affected the evolution of complex life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In her talk, Bergmann pushed attendees to reevaluate what they think a scientist is and how you become one. She produced one of her elementary school report cards, which showed some Bs and even Cs. “I don’t want you to be discouraged if you get a B or C in school. I was not discouraged. None of this report card, to me, is a sign of failure. It was a sign that I was learning hard things.” As a former middle school Earth and life science teacher and now EAPS professor, Bergmann understands what it’s like to be an educator and a lifelong investigator. Her teaching style, subject matter, and media foster curiosity within all types of learners: visual, auditory, kinesthetic, and more. Different scientists have different skills and take distinctive career paths, Bergmann noted. “Three things I want you to remember,” she said. “First, scientists can be explorers; they don’t always work in a lab. I’m probably not the scientist you were picturing building the time machine. Second, be creative and be curious, even if it means getting some B&#039;s or C&#039;s along the way. Learn from them. And third, I didn’t know that I would be a geologist when I was your age, but when I found geology, I loved it. I kept doing it, and I kept taking risks along the way.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked by a young girl if it’s hard to be scientist, Bergmann replied, “I love what I do ... and I work with great people. We’re all excited to tackle these big questions. So I don’t think it’s difficult to be a scientist.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterward, guests were encouraged to go on a scientific scavenger hunt, visiting exhibit stations and collecting a stamp after completing an activity at each. MIT faculty, students, and volunteers were out in full force, sharing the latest in oceanographic, meteorological and paleoclimatological research, data collection and explorations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several EAPS groups came out to support the event. Bergmann along with graduate students Julia Wilcots and Maya Stokes had a ripple tank and an impressive rock display: some with ripple patterns, one with beautiful shells that was once deposited in Ohio in an ocean, and another that was about a billion years old. Seeing these rocks challenged audiences to think about ancient landscapes and what environmental pressures might have kept life small. The&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.mit.edu/davidmcg/www/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;McGee Lab&lt;/a&gt;’s Gabi Serrato Marks, Michaela Fendrock, and Christine Chen showed guests how they use information from stalagmites, lake deposits, and other marine sediments to reconstruct ancient precipitation and wind patterns. They use this to see how these patterns responded to past climate changes in order to understand how rainfall might change in the future. Graduate students Astrid Pacini, Madeleine Youngs and professor&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://eapsweb.mit.edu/people/grflierl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Glenn Flierl&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;helped guests shift their frame to view to global dynamics of ocean and atmospheric currents, weather patterns, climate proxies, and more on the iGlobe, a large computerized spherical display. On a path laid out around the iGlobe, guests could “walk the Gulf Stream,” experiencing how fast the water moves north and then slows and meanders back south.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIT’s “&lt;a href=&quot;http://float.aerocene.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Aerocene&lt;/a&gt;” display — a project developed by MIT visiting artist Tomás Saraceno in collaboration with EAPS scientists&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://synoptic.mit.edu/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lodovica Illari&lt;/a&gt;, Glenn Flierl, and Bill McKenna — helps calculate the trajectories of a balloon-like structure around the globe. The hypothetical flight paths take into account atmospheric data and physics, and depend on when and where the structures are launched. Using the interface, Illari along with graduate students Catherine Wilka and Rohini Shivamoggi invited guests to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://float.aerocene.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“launch” virtual balloons&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;challenging them to land in a location of their choosing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Postdoc&amp;nbsp;Jonathan Lauderdale&amp;nbsp;from the Darwin group showed guests how ocean modelers turn marine ecological phenomena into mathematical relationships, in a popular “bugs to bytes” game. By “hunting” for Swedish Fish while blindfolded, Girls Day attendees could experience how food consumption by predators scales with food abundance to a point, after which there is an abundance of available prey, supporting a premise put forth by ecologist&amp;nbsp;Crawford Stanley &quot;Buzz&quot; Holling. Meanwhile, graduate students Mara Freilich, Tristan Abbott, and Henri Drake, along with lab assistant Bill McKenna and Professor John Marshall, illustrated the physics around ocean gyre circulation, specifically the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, with a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://weathertank.mit.edu/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Weather in a Tank&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;demonstration. Using a rotating tank of water with fans blowing on it to simulate the atmosphere and ocean currents that drive the Pacific Ocean gyre, audiences dropped paper bits into the swirling water; these pieces eventually found their way into the middle of the tank. An overhead camera locked to the turntable and projector allowed audiences to see the effect within the spinning framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graduate students and Women in Course 12 members Kelsey Moore, Ellen Lalk, Meghana Ranganathan, Jeemin Rhim, Clara Sousa-Silva, and Suzi Clark presented “The Women Behind Scientific Breakthroughs.” Here, attendees learned about pioneering women scientists and their research, one of which was EAPS&#039; own Susan Solomon. They then matched the story of the researcher’s work to one on a poster board and revealed her picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MIT Women in Aerospace Engineering (WAE) group also hosted a table with a set of activities about how we look at Earth from space. Volunteers talked about satellite data, then had the students look at themselves in an infrared camera and draw what they thought Earth would look like from space. This activity demonstrated how scientists and engineers look at the planet in many wavelengths in order to monitor the climate. They also had a demo about space and weather balloons using helium balloons and paper clips to experiment with buoyancy and equilibrium. WAE officer Raichelle Aniceto says, &quot;It was a lot of fun to see the girls think like scientists and learn about why balloons float!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cdev.13039&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;showed that outreach efforts by female scientists — like participation at the MIT Museum’s Girls Day, encouraging young women to pursue science careers — might be paying off. When asked to draw a scientist, U.S. kids aged 5 to 18 are increasingly depicting women, jumping from less than 1 percent to about 34 percent over 5 decades, and those sketched by girls was over 50 percent. This trend follows an uptick in the number of women in science professions. While there are likely many reasons for this, one is certainly mentorship and interaction with women in scientific fields.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Exploring the many roles of mucus</title>
    <link>http://news.mit.edu/2018/faculty-profile-katharina-ribbeck-0403</link>
    <description>Katharina Ribbeck studies the sticky substance to uncover its impacts on health and disease.</description>

 <guid isPermaLink="true">http://news.mit.edu/2018/faculty-profile-katharina-ribbeck-0403</guid>
<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In 2007, Katharina Ribbeck spent a year as a visiting scientist at Harvard Medical School. While there, she heard about a fellowship offered at Harvard that would provide
00006000
 the recipient with a lab, startup funding, and status as an independent investigator. The catch? Applicants had to propose starting a new field of study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Up to that point in her career, Ribbeck had been studying the nuclear pore — a channel that regulates communication between a cell’s nucleus and the rest of the cell. However, she was intrigued by the idea of studying mucus, which lines an enormous surface area of our bodies and plays a key role in maintaining health, yet at that time was not well-studied.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“So, I made a case for mucus,” recalls Ribbeck, now an associate professor of biological engineering at MIT. “I said we should study mucus because it’s a really amazing barrier. It allows us to integrate nutrients, it protects us from pathogens, and it allows us to communicate with the outside world. It’s also a major obstacle to drug delivery. But we have no idea how it works.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;cms-placeholder-content-video&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ribbeck got the fellowship, and ever since, she has been studying a substance that may have a high ick factor for some, but in reality is one of the most important defenses our body has against infection. Mucus also performs many other critical physiological functions, and by learning more about it, Ribbeck hopes to devise new ways to both diagnose and treat human disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There is a lot of information about our health in mucus,” she says. “Our goal for the next couple of years is to tap into this underutilized source of bioinformation and use it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking at the big picture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although Ribbeck’s parents were originally from Germany and Austria, she spent much of her early childhood in Guyana and Brazil, where her father worked as an urban planner. The family returned to Heidelberg, Germany, when Ribbeck was in elementary school.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a student, she was interested in science but also spent much of her time in the library perusing art books. One of her favorites was E.H. Gombrich’s “The Story of Art,” which she says has heavily influenced how she does science — a process she describes as similar to creating an artistic composition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“A single experiment is a small part of a bigger picture, and in doing science, you create a bigger picture that is coherent, well-balanced, striking but not misleading, that communicates the essence of what you discovered,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the University of Heidelberg, Ribbeck studied biology and biochemistry, and she spent her senior year at the University of California at San Diego working on her diploma thesis in neurobiology. In graduate school, also at the University of Heidelberg, she began studying the biology of the nuclear pore.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mucus, she says, “was never on my radar in grad school,” but like mucus, nuclear pores also act as barriers. These pores are highly selective channels that allow some particles to pass through, while blocking others. Many nuclear pore proteins behave like hydrogels that form sticky network structures, almost like a spider web. This structure is similar to that of mucins, the molecules that make up mucus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you take a few steps back, you see the nuclear pore is by no means the only filter that uses these gels. There is a whole class of materials that is based on very similar principles, where you have polymers that create meshes through which certain particles can pass through or not. Cartilage is another example; the extracellular matrix around tissues is another example,” Ribbeck says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After finishing her PhD, Ribbeck planned to start a research group in Germany, continuing her studies of the nuclear pore. However, her plans changed when a friend at Harvard Medical School suggested that she spend a year working in his lab. The decision was not easy for Ribbeck, but as she says, “it’s the things you don’t do that you regret. So I decided to go there, anticipating an interesting but not really life-changing year.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It was during that year, however, that Ribbeck applied for and received Harvard’s Bauer Fellowship to begin studying mucus. After about a year and a half, she realized that the field would benefit from the expertise and new tools being developed in MIT’s Department of Biological Engineering — in tissue science and engineering, microfluidics, and other areas. She got in touch with the department head, Doug Lauffenburger, and ended up joining the MIT faculty in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Detecting disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among the questions Ribbeck has pursued is why mucus is so successful at “taming” microbes that are normally pathogenic. Part of the answer is that mucus can suppress certain functions in microbes so that they can’t form pathogenic aggregates called biofilms, which tend to be more harmful than the cells are individually.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another major focus of her lab is analyzing how the stickiness and other biophysical properties of mucus change during illness, which could help researchers discover biomarkers that could be used to diagnose many different diseases. Last year, she published a study showing that changes in cervical mucus of pregnant women can &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.mit.edu/2017/cervical-mucus-predict-preterm-births-0904&quot;&gt;reveal their risk&lt;/a&gt; of going into labor too early.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other medical conditions that alter mucus include digestive diseases such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, as well as respiratory diseases. The “holy grail” of this effort, she says, is to link changes in saliva composition with diseases that affect mucosal surfaces elsewhere in the body.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you have aberrant mucus production in your mouth, there is a chance that this is true for other parts of the body,” Ribbeck says. “So, we might be able to pick up, from saliva, disease conditions of remote mucosal surfaces. That will be very exciting because of course that is noninvasive yet informative.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ribbeck says that her research is a natural topic of interest for children, which she takes advantage of to get them excited about science. She gives talks at the MIT Museum and Boston Museum of Science about her work, and she is also working on a children’s book starring a shape-shifting character made of mucus, highlighting the many roles that mucus plays in our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The intention here is to really introduce a field to the generations to come, so they grow up understanding that mucus is not a waste product. It’s an integral part of our physiology and a really important piece of our health,” Ribbeck says. “If we understand it, it can really give us a lot of information that will help us stay healthy and possibly treat diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;

 <guid isPermaLink="true">http://news.mit.edu/2018/ed-boyden-receives-2018-canada-gairdner-international-award-0327</guid>
<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ed Boyden, the Y. Eva Tan Professor in Neurotechnology at MIT has been named a recipient of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gairdner.org/award_winners/edward-s-boyden/&quot;&gt;2018 Canada Gairdner International Award&lt;/a&gt; — Canada’s most prestigious scientific prize — for his role in the discovery of light-gated ion channels and optogenetics, a technology to control brain activity with light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boyden’s work has given neuroscientists the ability to precisely activate or silence brain cells to see how they contribute to — or possibly alleviate — brain disease. By optogenetically controlling brain cells, it has become possible to understand how specific patterns of brain activity might be used to quiet seizures, cancel out Parkinsonian tremors, and make other improvements to brain health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boyden is one of three scientists the Gairdner Foundation is honoring for this work. He shares the prize with Peter Hegemann from Humboldt University of Berlin and Karl Deisseroth from Stanford University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am honored that the Gairdner Foundation has chosen our work in optogenetics for one of the most prestigious biology prizes awarded today,” says Boyden, who is also a member of MIT’s McGovern Institute for Brain Research and an associate professor in the&amp;nbsp;Media Lab, the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, and the Department of Biological Engineering at MIT. “It represents a great collaborative body of work, and I feel excited that my angle of thinking like a physicist was able to contribute to biology.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boyden, along with fellow laureate Karl Deisseroth, brainstormed about how microbial opsins could be used to mediate optical control of neural activity, while both were students in 2000. Together, they collaborated to demonstrate the first optical control of neural activity using microbial opsins in the summer of 2004, when Boyden was at Stanford. At MIT, Boyden’s team developed the first optogenetic silencing (2007), the first effective optogenetic silencing in live mammals (2010), noninvasive optogenetic silencing (2014), multicolor optogenetic control (2014), and temporally precise single-cell optogenetic control (2017).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to his work with optogenetics, Boyden has pioneered the development of many transformative technologies that image, record, and manipulate complex systems, including expansion microscopy and robotic patch clamping. He has received numerous awards for this work, including the Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences (2016), the BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award (2015), the Carnegie Prize in Mind and Body Sciences (2015), the Grete Lundbeck European Brain Prize (2013), and the Perl-UNC Neuroscience prize (2011). Boyden is an elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the National Academy of Inventors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are thrilled Ed has been recognized with the prestigious Gairdner Award for his work in developing optogenetics,” says Robert Desimone, director of the McGovern Institute. “Ed’s body of work has transformed neuroscience and biomedicine, and I am exceedingly proud of the contributions he has made to MIT and to the greater community of scientists worldwide.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Canada Gairdner International Awards, created in 1959, are given annually to recognize and reward the achievements of medical researchers whose work contributes significantly to the understanding of human biology and disease. The awards provide a $100,000 (CDN) prize to each scientist for their work. Each year, the five honorees of the International Awards are selected after a rigorous two-part review, with the winners voted by secret ballot by a medical advisory board composed of 33 eminent scientists from around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

<content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;cms-placeholder-content-video&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a child, Institute Professor Robert S. Langer was captivated by the “magic” of the chemical reactions in a toy chemistry set. Decades later, he continues to be enchanted by the potential of chemical engineering. He is the most cited engineer in the world, and shows no signs of slowing down, despite four decades of ground-breaking work in drug delivery and polymer research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Langer explains, “For me, magic has been discovering and inventing things. Discovering substances that can stop blood vessels from growing in the body, which can ultimately lead to treatments for cancer and blindness.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Langer Lab has had close to 1,000&amp;nbsp;students and postdocs go through its doors. Hundreds are now professors around the world. Many have started companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m very proud of all of them,” says Langer. “I hope that I help them a little bit. That’s what we try to do.”&lt;/p&gt;

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;June Park ’16, an alumna of Course 10 (chemical engineering), is one of 35 American students to be awarded this year’s competitive Gates Cambridge Scholarship. She is currently an associate consultant at Putnam Associates, where she helps generate and deliver strategic recommendations for global biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Park will attend Cambridge University to earn a PhD in bioengineering, and will be working to develop a biomimetic, 3-D-printable scaffold for the development of lung stem cell-derived artificial trachea and organoids. The successful development of an artificial trachea using the synthetic scaffold and patient stem cells may transform the treatment of tracheal injuries and diseases, significantly improving the survival and post-treatment quality of life for millions of patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While at MIT, Park participated in several Undergraduate Research Opportunities Programs, including in the labs of Professor Bernhardt L. Trout at the Novartis-MIT Center for Continuous Manufacturing and Institute Professor Robert S. Langer at the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research. In the Trout Lab, Park studied polymer thin films for continuous manufacturing of pharmaceuticals. In the Langer Lab, she helped develop an ultrasound-mediated colonic drug-delivery device that became the platform technology for Suono Bio, a Boston-based biotech startup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Studying chemical and biological engineering at MIT opened up doors to a lot of interdisciplinary research opportunities, and helped me discover my passion for polymers and biology,” Park explains. “Beyond fluids and transport, Course 10B taught me a broad set of skills, from generating polymer nanoparticles and growing cells to modeling 3-D acoustics, building electronics, and doing genetics research.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With keen interests in both education and entrepreneurship, Park also cofounded the Kepler Tech Laboratory while at MIT. Located in Kigali, Rwanda, Kepler Tech Lab is an innovation hub for business students to develop new endeavors to improve the energy and recycling industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Park says she is looking&amp;nbsp;forward to this next step in her engineering career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The chemical engineering department and MIT at large have provided invaluable mentorship for navigating careers in both business and research. Even after graduation while working in consulting, the chemical engineering faculties and the MIT fellowship resources were generously offered to me,” she says.&amp;nbsp;“I am extremely grateful for the MIT ChemE department and am excited to be joining the Gates Cambridge community.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Park was assisted in her application by Kim Benard in the Office of Distinguished Fellowships.&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14.6667px;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;Established by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 2000, the Gates Cambridge Scholarship provides full funding for talented students from outside the United Kingdom to pursue postgraduate study in any subject at Cambridge University. The 2018 awards process was extremely competitive: There were nearly 800 applicants from around the country, with 35 ultimately chosen. Since the program’s inception in 2001, there have been 27 Gates Cambridge Scholars from MIT.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>“Body on a chip” could improve drug evaluation</title>
    <link>http://news.mit.edu/2018/body-chip-could-improve-drug-evaluation-0314</link>
    <description>Human tissue samples linked by microfluidic channels replicate interactions of multiple organs.</description>

 <guid isPermaLink="true">http://news.mit.edu/2018/body-chip-could-improve-drug-evaluation-0314</guid>
<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MIT engineers have developed new technology that could be used to evaluate new drugs and detect possible side effects before the drugs are tested in humans. Using a microfluidic platform that connects engineered tissues from up to 10 organs, the researchers can accurately replicate human organ interactions for weeks at a time, allowing them to measure the effects of drugs on different parts of the body.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such a system could reveal, for example, whether a drug that is intended to treat one organ will have adverse effects on another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Some of these effects are really hard to predict from animal models because the situations that lead to them are idiosyncratic,” says Linda Griffith, the School of Engineering Professor of Teaching Innovation, a professor of biological engineering and mechanical engineering, and one of the senior authors of the study. “With our chip, you can distribute a drug and then look for the effects on other tissues, and measure the exposure and how it is metabolized.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These chips could also be used to evaluate antibody drugs and other immunotherapies, which are difficult to test thoroughly in animals because they are designed to interact with the human immune system.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;David Trumper, an MIT professor of mechanical engineering, and Murat Cirit, a research scientist in the Department of Biological Engineering, are also senior authors of the paper, which appears in the journal &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;. The paper’s lead authors are former MIT postdocs Collin Edington and Wen Li Kelly Chen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modeling organs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When developing a new drug, researchers identify drug targets based on what they know about the biology of the disease, and then create compounds that affect those targets. Preclinical testing in animals can offer information about a drug’s safety and effectiveness before human testing begins, but those tests may not reveal potential side effects, Griffith says. Furthermore, drugs that work in animals often fail in human trials.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Animals do not represent people in all the facets that you need to develop drugs and understand disease,” Griffith says. “That is becoming more and more apparent as we look across all kinds of drugs.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Complications can also arise due to variability among individual patients, including their genetic background, environmental influences, lifestyles, and other drugs they may be taking. “A lot of the time you don’t see problems with a drug, particularly something that might be widely prescribed, until it goes on the market,” Griffith says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As part of a project spearheaded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Griffith and her colleagues decided to pursue a technology that they call a “physiome on a chip,” which they believe could offer a way to model potential drug effects more accurately and rapidly. To achieve this, the researchers needed new equipment — a platform that would allow tissues to grow and interact with each other — as well as engineered tissue that would accurately mimic the functions of human organs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before this project was launched, no one had succeeded in connecting more than a few different tissue types on a platform. Furthermore, most researchers working on this kind of chip were working with closed microfluidic systems, which allow fluid to flow in and out but do not offer an easy way to manipulate what is happening inside the chip. These systems also require external pumps.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The MIT team decided to create an open system, which essentially r
00006000
emoves the lid and makes it easier to manipulate the system and remove samples for analysis. Their system, adapted from technology they previously developed and commercialized through U.K.-based CN BioInnovations, also incorporates several on-board pumps that can control the flow of liquid between the “organs,” replicating the circulation of blood, immune cells, and proteins through the human body. The pumps also allow larger engineered tissues, for example tumors within an organ, to be evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complex interactions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers created several versions of their chip, linking up to 10 organ types: liver, lung, gut, endometrium, brain, heart, pancreas, kidney, skin, and skeletal muscle. Each “organ” consists of clusters of 1 million to 2 million cells. These tissues don’t replicate the entire organ, but they do perform many of its important functions. Significantly, most of the tissues come directly from patient samples rather than from cell lines that have been developed for lab use. These so-called “primary cells” are more difficult to work with but offer a more representative model of organ function, Griffith says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using this system, the researchers showed that they could deliver a drug to the gastrointestinal tissue, mimicking oral ingestion of a drug, and then observe as the drug was transported to other tissues and metabolized. They could measure where the drugs went, the effects of the drugs on different tissues, and how the drugs were broken down. In a related publication, the researchers modeled how drugs can cause unexpected stress on the liver by making the gastrointestinal tract “leaky,” allowing bacteria to enter the bloodstream and produce inflammation in the liver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kevin Healy, a professor of bioengineering and materials science and engineering at the University of California at Berkeley, says that this kind of system holds great potential for accurate prediction of complex adverse drug reactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“While microphysiological systems (MPS) featuring single organs can be of great use for both pharmaceutical testing and basic organ-level studies, the huge potential of MPS technology is revealed by connecting multiple organ chips in an integrated system for &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; pharmacology. This study beautifully illustrates that multi-MPS “physiome-on-a-chip” approaches, which combine the genetic background of human cells with physiologically relevant tissue-to-media volumes, allow accurate prediction of drug pharmacokinetics and drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion,” says Healy, who was not involved in the research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Griffith believes that the most immediate applications for this technology involve modeling two to four organs. Her lab is now developing a model system for Parkinson’s disease that includes brain, liver, and gastrointestinal tissue, which she plans to use to investigate the hypothesis that bacteria found in the gut can influence the development of Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other applications include modeling tumors that metastasize to other parts of the body, she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“An advantage of our platform is that we can scale it up or down and accommodate a lot of different configurations,” Griffith says. “I think the field is going to go through a transition where we start to get more information out of a three-organ or four-organ system, and it will start to become cost-competitive because the information you’re getting is so much more valuable.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by the U.S. Army Research Office and DARPA.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New study solves an arthritis drug mystery</title>
    <link>http://news.mit.edu/2018/new-study-solves-arthritis-drug-mystery-0306</link>
    <description>MIT biological engineers discover why a promising drug failed in clinical trials.</description>
     <pubDate>Tue, 06 Mar 2018 13:59:59 -0500</pubDate>

 <guid isPermaLink="true">http://news.mit.edu/2018/new-study-solves-arthritis-drug-mystery-0306</guid>
<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Pharmaceutical companies once considered a protein called p38 a very attractive target for treating rheumatoid arthritis. Arthritis patients usually have elevated activity of this inflammation-producing protein, and in lab studies p38 inhibitors appeared to soothe inflammation. However, these drugs failed in several clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A new study from MIT sheds light on just why these drugs did not work for arthritis. By untangling the complex interactions between different cell pathways involved in inflammation, the researchers discovered that shutting off p38 triggers other inflammatory pathways.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings demonstrate the importance of studying a potential drug’s impact on complex cellular systems, says Doug Lauffenburger, head of MIT’s Department of Biological Engineering and the senior author of the study. It’s also important to do these studies under environmental conditions that match those found in diseased tissue, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You’ve got to make sure you understand the complexity of the intracellular networks, and beyond that, you need to think about the environment you put the cells in,” Lauffenburger says. “It’s easy to get different results in different contexts, so you need to study them under many different conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Former MIT postdoc Doug Jones is the lead author of the paper, which appears in the March 6 issue of &lt;em&gt;Science Signaling&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A promising target&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rheumatoid arthritis, which afflicts more than 1 million Americans, is an autoimmune disorder that produces swollen and painful joints, primarily affecting the wrists and hands. This pain results from inflammation in the lining of the joints. Cells called synovial fibroblasts, which typically provide structural support for the joint lining, promote the inflammation and swelling in arthritic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Several years ago, scientists seeking new treatments for arthritis discovered that synovial fibroblasts from arthritis patients had very high levels of p38, and many pharmaceutical companies began working on p38 inhibitors. “The activity of this pathway was so strong that people tended to think that it was the best one to inhibit,” Lauffenburger says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite their promise, p38 inhibitors failed in phase II clinical trials run by at least eight pharmaceutical companies. One of those companies, Boehringer Ingelheim, asked Lauffenburger to help them figure out why. Lauffenburger’s lab focuses on systems biology, a field that involves measuring the interactions of many cell components and then performing computational modeling of those measurements to predict cell behavior.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers’ analysis revealed that the inflammatory pathway controlled by p38 interacts with several other pathways that can cause inflammation. These pathways, known collectively as stress pathways, produce inflammatory cytokines in response to events such as infection or injury.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The MIT team found that when p38 is extremely elevated, it suppresses the activity of these other inflammatory pathways. Therefore, when it gets turned off, the brake on the other pathways is released. Under these circumstances, inflammation remains high — the difference is that now it is controlled by other stress pathways.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is an insightful paper on redundancy in signaling and the need to understand compensatory mechanisms before spending billions on drug development. In that sense, it is a far more important insight than ‘just’ p38 inhibitors, and it makes clear again that animal efficacy models have severe limitations as tools to predict human efficacy,” says David De Graaf, CEO and president of Syntimmune, who was not involved in the research. “This paper outlines one very thoughtful and generic approach to answer complex questions about efficacy in &lt;em&gt;ex vivo&lt;/em&gt; human model systems.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Environment matters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Why was the MIT team able to see this phenomenon when others had not? Lauffenburger says one key is the environment in which the synovial fibroblast cells were studied.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Normally, cells studied in the lab are grown in a culture medium that offers them nutrients and molecules called growth factors, which keep the cells alive and proliferating. However, the MIT team found that under these conditions, a pro-growth pathway called MEK actually keeps p38 levels lower than in cells under stress. Because p38 is not as high, it doesn’t inhibit the other stress pathways as strongly, so when the cells are exposed to p38 inhibitors, the other pathways don’t soar into action and overall inflammation goes down.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It looks like p38 inhibitors work well, if cells are in these growth factor environments,” Lauffenburger says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the MIT team found that synovial fluid from arthritis patients is not a pro-growth environment but is full of inflammatory cytokines. They then decided to expose synovial fibroblasts taken from patients with arthritis and from healthy individuals to this inflammatory environment. In both healthy and diseased cells, p38 levels skyrocketed, producing more inflammation and shutting off other stress pathways.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One question still to be answered is whether p38 inhibitors could work against other diseases such as cancer, in which the cells targeted would likely be in a pro-growth environment. They are also being considered as potential treatments for other inflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer’s. Lauffenburger says that their success will likely depend on what kind of environment the affected cells are in.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“A p38 inhibitor could work; you just have to know what the context is that the target cells are in. If you have the same kind of inflammatory cytokines there, then you might encounter the same problem” seen in arthritis, he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s also possible that p38 inhibitors could work against arthritis or other diseases if given along with drugs that shut off other stress pathways, but more research would be needed to investigate that possibility, Lauffenburger says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health, the Army Research Office, and Boehringer Ingelheim Inc. The project was undertaken in collaboration with Professor Peter Sorger at Harvard Medical School; Brian Joughin at MIT and Anne Jenney at Harvard were also significantly involved in the work.&lt;/p&gt;

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Edward S. Boyden, a member of MIT’s McGovern Institute for Brain Research and the Media Lab, and an associate professor of brain and cognitive sciences and biological engineering at MIT, has been appointed the inaugural Y. Eva Tan Professor in Neurotechnology. The new professorship has been established at the McGovern Institute by K. Lisa Yang in honor of her daughter Y. Eva Tan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are thrilled Lisa has made a generous investment in neurotechnology and the McGovern Institute by creating this new chair,” says Robert Desimone, director of the McGovern Institute. “Ed’s body of work has already transformed neuroscience and biomedicine, and this chair will help his team to further develop revolutionary tools that will have a profound impact on research worldwide.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2017, Yang co-founded the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mcgovern.mit.edu/TanYangCenter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hock E. Tan and K. Lisa Yang Center for Autism Research&lt;/a&gt; at the McGovern Institute. The center catalyzes interdisciplinary and cutting-edge research into the genetic, biological, and brain bases of autism spectrum disorders. In late 2017, Yang grew the center with the establishment of the endowed J. Douglas Tan Postdoctoral Research Fund, which supports talented postdocs in the lab of Poitras Professor of Neuroscience Guoping Feng.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am excited to further expand the Hock E. Tan and K. Lisa Yang Center for Autism Research and to support Ed and his team’s critical work,” says Yang. “Novel technology is the driving force behind much-needed breakthroughs in brain research — not just for individuals with autism, but for those living with all brain disorders. My daughter Eva and I are greatly pleased to recognize Ed’s talent and to contribute toward his future successes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yang’s daughter agrees.&amp;nbsp;“I’m so pleased this professorship will have a significant&amp;nbsp;and lasting impact on MIT’s pioneering work in neurotechnology,” says Tan. “My family and I have always believed that advances in technology are what make all scientific progress possible, and I’m overjoyed that we can help enable amazing&amp;nbsp;discoveries in the Boyden Lab&amp;nbsp;through Ed’s appointment to this chair.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boyden has pioneered the development of many transformative technologies that image, record, and manipulate complex systems, including optogenetics, expansion microscopy, and robotic patch clamping. He has received numerous awards for this work, including the Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences (2016), the BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award (2015), the Carnegie Prize in Mind and Body Sciences (2015), the Grete Lundbeck European Brain Prize (2013), and the Perl-UNC Neuroscience prize (2011). Boyden is an elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the National Academy of Inventors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I deeply appreciate the honor that comes with being named the first Y. Eva Tan Professor in Neurotechnology,” says Boyden. “This is a tremendous recognition of not only my team’s work, but the groundbreaking impact of the neurotechnology field.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boyden joined MIT in 2007 as an assistant professor at the Media Lab, and later was appointed as a joint professor in the departments of Brain and Cognitive Sciences and Biological Engineering and an investigator in the McGovern Institute. In 2011, he was named the Benesse Career Development Professor, and in 2013 he was awarded the AT&amp;amp;T Career Development Professorship. Seven years after arriving at MIT, he was awarded tenure. Boyden earned his BS and MEng from MIT in 1999 and his PhD in Neuroscience from Stanford University in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Timothy Lu seeks to combat disease by reprogramming biological systems</title>
    <link>http://news.mit.edu/2018/faculty-profile-timothy-lu-0305</link>
    <description>Synthetic biologist hopes to develop treatments for cancer and other diseases.</description>
     <pubDate>Sun, 04 Mar 2018 23:59:59 -0500</pubDate>
 <dc:creator>Anne Trafton | MIT News Office</dc:creator>
 <guid isPermaLink="true">http://news.mit.edu/2018/faculty-profile-timothy-lu-0305</guid>
<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In high school and college, Timothy Lu spent a lot of time programming computers. But as his college graduation approached, he turned his attention toward programming biological systems. The field of synthetic biology was just beginning to emerge, and he wanted to be part of it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since that time, Lu has devoted his career to coming up with novel ways to engineer cells, both bacterial and human, to perform new functions. Using this approach, he hopes to develop new therapies for a range of diseases, from cancer to drug-resistant infections.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Achieving this goal requires overcoming many more challenges than programming computer chips does, he says, because living cells behave in more unpredictable ways and the underlying programming language is not deeply understood.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The advantage of the semiconductor industry is they were able to build individual units and put them together and scale them very efficiently. They weren’t putting things into an existing system that was already messy and where you didn’t know the wiring diagram,” says Lu, who recently earned tenure in MIT’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. “In contrast, we’re simultaneously trying to figure out how to assemble genetic circuits together and also stick it into this giant mish-mash of what the cell normally does. That’s the key challenge.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fundamental challenges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lu’s early interest in computer programming was inspired by his father, who worked as an electrical engineer at IBM.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“My dad brought home some of the early PCs that they were building at IBM, and I spent a lot of time programming computers and making them do very simple things,” Lu recalls.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When Lu was 10 years old, his family moved from upstate New York to Taiwan, where his parents had grown up. He returned to the United States to attend MIT, where he majored in electrical engineering and computer science. When he graduated in 2003, Lu realized that he enjoyed programming but wanted to apply this interest to nascent technologies with fundamental challenges that had yet to be solved.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He soon became intrigued by the idea of programming biological systems. Many Boston-area researchers were beginning to work in this field, known as synthetic biology. Lu decided to apply to the Harvard-MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology (HST), and he arranged to do his PhD research in a lab at Boston University headed by synthetic biology pioneer James Collins (who is now a faculty member at MIT).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As part of his HST coursework, Lu saw many patients with antibiotic-resistant infections and became interested in trying to develop new treatments for such infections. In Collins’ lab, Lu worked on engineering viruses that infect bacteria, also known as bacteriophages. He engineered these bacteriophages to produce enzymes that help to chew up biofilms (layers of bacteria that stick to surfaces), and in 2008, he &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.mit.edu/2008/lemelson-student-0227&quot;&gt;won the Lemelson-MIT Student Prize&lt;/a&gt; for this work. In a related project, he engineered bacteria to express factors that make them more susceptible to existing antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After finishing his PhD, and an MD as well, Lu pondered a few career paths, including practicing medicine or working at a startup based on his research, but he ended up applying for a faculty position in MIT’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, which was looking for someone interested in programming biological circuits. MIT had recently hired a couple of prominent synthetic biologists to launch the Institute’s new Synthetic Biology Center, and Lu was eager to get involved.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“At the time, MIT was trying to build up its synthetic biology team. I knew if I joined I would be the most junior member but would be part of something that was going to quickly grow, so it was exciting for me,” says Lu, who later received a joint appointment in MIT’s Department of Biological Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disease-fighting circuits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Much of Lu’s research focuses on designing genetic circuits that can perform computations in living cells, such as counting events or tracking whether a specific event has occurred and then provoking the appropriate response.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“My deepest personal interest is in the clinical applications of synthetic biology,” Lu says. “Can you program cells or viruses to sense and respond to their environment, so that you can try to detect the presence of disease and treat it effectively and safely?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a recent study, Lu and his colleagues &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.mit.edu/2017/gene-circuit-switches-inside-cancer-cells-triggers-immune-attack-1019&quot;&gt;developed a synthetic gene circuit&lt;/a&gt; that triggers the body’s immune system to attack cancers when it detects signs of the disease. They are also working on designing more control elements to help them turn such circuits on and off, and developing ways to help circuits change their output in response to different disease biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lu’s lab also continues to pursue novel antimicrobial treatments, including engineered bacteriophages as well as &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.mit.edu/2016/engineers-design-new-weapon-against-bacteria-1102&quot;&gt;new types of antimicrobial peptides&lt;/a&gt;. By modifying these naturally occurring proteins, Lu hopes to make them more efficient at killing microbes, and potentially to develop them for use against infection in humans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such research has become increasingly important, Lu says, as more strains of bacteria become resistant to existing drugs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When we first started, in the early 2000s, people didn’t care about antibiotic resistance that much. Most antibiotics were still working and people didn’t think it was a big deal,” he says. “But over time, resistance has continued to grow, and the antibiotic pipeline has become drier and 
00006000
drier. So we still firmly believe that we need new strategies. The days when you would just go and dig in the dirt and easily find new antibiotics with broad-spectrum activity are over.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Seeing the brain&amp;#039;s electrical activity</title>
    <link>http://news.mit.edu/2018/seeing-brains-electrical-activity-0226</link>
    <description>Fluorescent sensor allows imaging of neurons&amp;#039; electrical communications, without electrodes.</description>
     <pubDate>Mon, 26 Feb 2018 11:00:00 -0500</pubDate>

 <guid isPermaLink="true">http://news.mit.edu/2018/seeing-brains-electrical-activity-0226</guid>
<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurons in the brain communicate via rapid electrical impulses that allow the brain to coordinate behavior, sensation, thoughts, and emotion. Scientists who want to study this electrical activity usually measure these signals with electrodes inserted into the brain, a task that is notoriously difficult and time-consuming.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;MIT researchers have now come up with a completely different approach to measuring electrical activity in the brain, which they believe will prove much easier and more informative. They have developed a light-sensitive protein that can be embedded into neuron membranes, where it emits a fluorescent signal that indicates how much voltage a particular cell is experiencing. This could allow scientists to study how neurons behave, millisecond by millisecond, as the brain performs a particular function.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you put an electrode in the brain, it’s like trying to understand a phone conversation by hearing only one person talk,” says Edward Boyden, an associate professor of biological engineering and brain and cognitive sciences at MIT. “Now we can record the neural activity of many cells in a neural circuit and hear them as they talk to each other.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Boyden, who is also a member of MIT’s Media Lab, McGovern Institute for Brain Research, and Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, and an HHMI-Simons Faculty Scholar, is the senior author of the study, which appears in the Feb. 26 issue of &lt;em&gt;Nature Chemical Biology&lt;/em&gt;. The paper’s lead authors are MIT postdocs Kiryl Piatkevich and Erica Jung.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imaging voltage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the past two decades, scientists have sought a way to monitor electrical activity in the brain through imaging instead of recording with electrodes. Finding fluorescent molecules that can be used for this kind of imaging has been difficult; not only do the proteins have to be very sensitive to changes in voltage, they must also respond quickly and be resistant to photobleaching (fading that can be caused by exposure to light).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Boyden and his colleagues came up with a new strategy for finding a molecule that would fulfill everything on this wish list: They built a robot that could screen millions of proteins, generated through a process called directed protein evolution, for the traits they wanted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You take a gene, then you make millions and millions of mutant genes, and finally you pick the ones that work the best,” Boyden says. “That’s the way that evolution works in nature, but now we’re doing it in the lab with robots so we can pick out the genes with the properties we want.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers made 1.5 million mutated versions of a light-sensitive protein called QuasAr2, which was previously engineered by Adam Cohen’s lab at Harvard University. (That work, in turn, was based on the molecule Arch, which &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.mit.edu/2010/brain-control-0107&quot;&gt;the Boyden lab reported in 2010&lt;/a&gt;.) The researchers put each of those genes into mammalian cells (one mutant per cell), then grew the cells in lab dishes and used an automated microscope to take pictures of the cells. The robot was able to identify cells with proteins that met the criteria the researchers were looking for, the most important being the protein’s location within the cell and its brightness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research team then selected five of the best candidates and did another round of mutation, generating 8 million new candidates. The robot picked out the seven best of these, which the researchers then narrowed down to one top performer, which they called Archon1.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mapping the brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A key feature of Archon1 is that once the gene is delivered into a cell, the Archon1 protein embeds itself into the cell membrane, which is the best place to obtain an accurate measurement of a cell’s voltage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using this protein, the researchers were able to measure electrical activity in mouse brain tissue, as well as in brain cells of zebrafish larvae and the worm &lt;em&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/em&gt;. The latter two organisms are transparent, so it is easy to expose them to light and image the resulting fluorescence. When the cells are exposed to a certain wavelength of reddish-orange light, the protein sensor emits a longer wavelength of red light, and the brightness of the light corresponds to the voltage of that cell at a given moment in time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers also showed that Archon1 can be used in conjunction with light-sensitive proteins that are commonly used to silence or stimulate neuron activity — these are known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.mit.edu/2014/optogenetic-toolkit-goes-multicolor-0209&quot;&gt;optogenetic proteins&lt;/a&gt; — as long as those proteins respond to colors other than red. In experiments with &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt;, the researchers demonstrated that they could stimulate one neuron using blue light and then use Archon1 to measure the resulting effect in neurons that receive input from that cell.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cohen, the Harvard professor who developed the predecessor to Archon1, says the new MIT protein brings scientists closer to the goal of imaging millisecond-timescale electrical activity in live brains.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Traditionally, it has been excruciatingly labor-intensive to engineer fluorescent voltage indicators, because each mutant had to be cloned individually and then tested through a slow, manual patch-clamp electrophysiology measurement.&amp;nbsp;The Boyden lab developed a very clever high-throughput screening approach to this problem,” says Cohen, who was not involved in this study. “Their new reporter looks really great in fish and worms and in brain slices. I’m eager to try it in my lab.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers are now working on using this technology to measure brain activity in mice as they perform various tasks, which Boyden believes should allow them to map neural circuits and discover how they produce specific behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We will be able to watch a neural computation happen,” he says. “Over the next five years or so we’re going to try to solve some small brain circuits completely. Such results might take a step toward understanding what a thought or a feeling actually is.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by the HHMI-Simons Faculty Scholars Program, the IET Harvey Prize, the MIT Media Lab, the New York Stem Cell Foundation Robertson Award, the Open Philanthropy Project, John Doerr, the Human Frontier Science Program, the Department of Defense, the National Science Foundation, and the National Institutes of Health, including an NIH Director’s Pioneer Award.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Exploring his depth of field</title>
    <link>http://news.mit.edu/2018/student-profile-corban-swain-0222</link>
    <description>Photographer, poet, and PhD student in biological engineering Corban Swain pursues diverse interests with a keen eye. 
</description>
     <pubDate>Wed, 21 Feb 2018 23:59:59 -0500</pubDate>
 <dc:creator>Bridget E. Begg | Office of Graduate Education</dc:creator>
 <guid isPermaLink="true">http://news.mit.edu/2018/student-profile-corban-swain-0222</guid>
<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Corban Swain has inherited his idiosyncratic nature from his hometown. Huntsville, Alabama, has a dynamic history in the deep south: Originally a small cotton mill town, its selection as a post-WWII missile development site catapulted it into the space race. Later, it became an engineering enclave and hotspot for biotechnology.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Corban, too, defies stereotypes and ably wrangles his varied identities, as an artist and a scientist, a perfectionist and a procrastinator, a poet and an engineer, and — what in his youth sometimes seemed to him to be a dichotomy — an “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RB3F1zvcUvc&quot;&gt;intellectual brother&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now a first-year PhD student in biological engineering, Swain originally considered medical school while he was a student at Washington University in St. Louis. However, the year he took off of school to work as a full-time laboratory technician transformed his perspective on research. “It was definitely a tough decision because my path had been fairly linear up to that point … but so much personal and spiritual growth happened over that time,” he says. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Working in the lab, Swain, who is also a &lt;a href=&quot;http://corbanswain.wixsite.com/photo&quot;&gt;professional photographer&lt;/a&gt;, found himself compelled by the prospect of designing a physical tool to answer questions about invisible, microscopic phenomena — an interest that led him to MIT. Currently completing a laboratory rotation where he uses mathematical methods to reconstruct three-dimensional brain activity maps from light-field microscope images, Swain is drawn to visualization and the pursuit of a compelling image. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As he makes his way through his PhD program, Swain plans to continue to meld his technical and artistic interests, while exploring the potential for innovation that lies at the intersection of biology, engineering, and medicine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multidimensional identity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With the help of an artificial sun lamp, Swain is adjusting to his first Boston winter. As a first year, he is still exploring the Cambridge area from his apartment near Central Square. He particularly enjoys the live jazz at Wally’s Café, just across the river in Boston. While he has “mixed feelings” regarding the sometimes-hipster character of Cambridge (he espouses skepticism for a wood-grained drip coffee maker he encountered in a local café), he’s found the city to be a compelling place to take photographs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Swain’s interest in photography began in high school, when he took a black-and-white photography class. His interest piqued, he participated in yearbook design in high school, and then transitioned to professional photography in college, where he began to focus primarily on headshots. At first this was a pragmatic choice — headshots are commonly in demand for laboratory websites and LinkedIn profiles — but taking portraits became a creative exercise that suited his perfectionistic tendencies and his desire to “really get good at something.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Swain, a great headshot relies on fine facial details and angles of light: “Fifty-plus percent is just forming a connection with the person … just to break the tension. [Then there are] angular things, where you put the light, the shoulders, a head tilt. You know when photographers do that? They’re actually doing stuff!” He laughs. “It’s little, subtle changes.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Coming full circle, Swain is currently participating in a black-and-white photography course at MIT. Among the &lt;a href=&quot;http://corbanswain.wixsite.com/photo/portal&quot;&gt;striking photos&lt;/a&gt; he is developing in black and white include a “Black Lives Matter” chalk drawing from a sidewalk near the Loop in St. Louis, and a portrait of a pair of sharply dressed young men at the 50th anniversary of the Selma bridge crossing, staring straight into the camera.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Swain readily admits to an obsession with aesthetic detail in all aspects of his work. His eye for simplicity allows him to distill information in plots and graphics, but he also laughs at the time he spends on line spacing on even the smallest assignment, and notes that he has to manage his perfectionism in order to meet the hard deadlines of his academic work. This sometimes presents a challenge for someone who takes the time to organize their photos individually by year, then season, then (numbered, dated) shoot, then (numbered, dated) photo.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Swain’s other artistic interest, slam poetry, allows him to express himself personally and politically through performance. As a student in St. Louis, he, with many others, used slam poetry as a medium for protest and catharsis during the Ferguson protests of Michael Brown’s murder. His emotional poem &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/kYVwLbVInaE&quot;&gt;“The Silence of Michael Brown”&lt;/a&gt; was directly influenced by this challenging time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A self-described introvert, Swain also feels able to explore his own thoughts on identity and race through performance. One poem, entitled “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KApPT_XTEYs&quot;&gt;N*****&lt;/a&gt;,” was written in response to a prank on his college campus in which fraternity initiates used the n-word publicly, in a rap, in front of black students. Swain’s piece, a powerful salvo as well as a withering rebuke, describes the significance the word holds as both an inheritance of slavery and a weapon used against him.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Settling in at MIT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While Swain says he finally feels at home in his “nerdiness” at MIT, he occasionally misses the easy camaraderie of his black friends, whom he recently saw at their WashU reunion: “I had a big group of black friends. And there’s a certain dynamic there, of black culture. … I haven’t really found that space here, as of yet. And so that’s kind of tough.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Swain is the only black student in his cohort in the biological engineering department, and while he is a member of a variety of groups for minority students — he is a Sloan-MIT University Center for Exemplary Mentoring (UCEM) Fellow, a member of Academy of Courageous Minority Engineers (ACME), and recently attended the Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students (ABRCMS) — he still finds that the underrepresentation of black graduate students and faculty can inhibit him from feeling completely natural in his black identity at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Currently rotating among bioengineering labs, Swain will join a permanent lab next month. He’s shouldering a heavy course load, lightened by a hugely supportive department and a close relationship with his cohort. He buys a card for each of his classmates’ birthdays for everyone to sign.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For now, Swain says he would be happiest developing software and tools in a lab that would prepare him for a future professorship. Swain is more interested in the design and advancement of bioengineering technology broadly than in any one specific application thereof. This is a natural extension of a tendency to see connections rather than limitations; it is clear that Swain has come to MIT to create.&lt;/p&gt;

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The team that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.broadinstitute.org/node/22861&quot;&gt;first unveiled&lt;/a&gt; the rapid, inexpensive, highly sensitive CRISPR-based diagnostic tool called SHERLOCK has greatly enhanced the tool’s power, and has developed a miniature paper test that allows results to be seen with the naked eye — without the need for expensive equipment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The SHERLOCK team developed a simple paper strip to display test results for a single genetic signature, borrowing from the visual cues common in pregnancy tests. After dipping the paper strip into a processed sample, a line appears, indicating whether the target molecule was detected or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/sites/mit.edu.newsoffice/files/Sherlock_Animated.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This new feature helps pave the way for field use, such as during an outbreak. The team has also increased the sensitivity of SHERLOCK and
00006000
 added the capacity to accurately quantify the amount of target in a sample and test for multiple targets at once. All together, these advancements accelerate SHERLOCK’s ability to quickly and precisely detect genetic signatures — including pathogens and tumor DNA — in samples.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Described today in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, the innovations build on the team’s earlier version of SHERLOCK (shorthand for Specific High Sensitivity Reporter unLOCKing) and add to a growing field of research that harnesses CRISPR systems for uses beyond gene editing. The work, led by researchers from the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and from MIT, has the potential for a transformative effect on research and global public health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“SHERLOCK provides an inexpensive, easy-to-use, and sensitive diagnostic method for detecting nucleic acid material — and that can mean a virus, tumor DNA, and many other targets,” said senior author &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.broadinstitute.org/node/7577&quot;&gt;Feng Zhang&lt;/a&gt;, a core institute member of the Broad Institute, an investigator at the McGovern Institute, and the James and Patricia Poitras ’63 Professor in Neuroscience and associate professor in the departments of Brain and Cognitive Sciences and Biological Engineering at MIT. “The SHERLOCK improvements now give us even more diagnostic information and put us closer to a tool that can be deployed in real-world applications.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers previously showcased SHERLOCK’s utility for a range of applications. In the new study, the team uses SHERLOCK to detect cell-free tumor DNA in blood samples from lung cancer patients and to detect synthetic Zika and Dengue virus simultaneously, in addition to other demonstrations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clear results on a paper strip&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The new paper readout for SHERLOCK lets you see whether your target was present in the sample, without instrumentation,” said co-first author Jonathan Gootenberg, a Harvard graduate student in Zhang’s lab as well as the lab of Broad core institute member Aviv Regev. “This moves us much closer to a field-ready diagnostic.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team envisions a wide range of uses for SHERLOCK, thanks to its versatility in nucleic acid target detection. “The technology demonstrates potential for many health care applications, including diagnosing infections in patients and detecting mutations that confer drug resistance or cause cancer, but it can also be used for industrial and agricultural applications where monitoring steps along the supply chain can reduce waste and improve safety,” added Zhang.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the core of SHERLOCK’s success is a CRISPR-associated protein called Cas13, which can be programmed to bind to a specific piece of RNA. Cas13’s target can be any genetic sequence, including viral genomes, genes that confer antibiotic resistance in bacteria, or mutations that cause cancer. In certain circumstances, once Cas13 locates and cuts its specified target, the enzyme goes into overdrive, indiscriminately cutting other RNA nearby. To create SHERLOCK, the team harnessed this “off-target” activity and turned it to their advantage, engineering the system to be compatible with both DNA and RNA.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SHERLOCK’s diagnostic potential relies on additional strands of synthetic RNA that are used to create a signal after being cleaved. Cas13 will chop up this RNA after it hits its original target, releasing the signaling molecule, which results in a readout that indicates the presence or absence of the target.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multiple targets and increased sensitivity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The SHERLOCK platform can now be adapted to test for multiple targets. SHERLOCK initially could only detect one nucleic acid sequence at a time, but now one analysis can give fluorescent signals for up to four different targets at once — meaning less sample is required to run through diagnostic panels. For example, the new version of SHERLOCK can determine in a single reaction whether a sample contains Zika or dengue virus particles, which both cause similar symptoms in patients. The platform uses Cas13 and Cas12a (previously known as Cpf1) enzymes from different species of bacteria to generate the additional signals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SHERLOCK’s second iteration also uses an additional CRISPR-associated enzyme to amplify its detection signal, making the tool more sensitive than its predecessor. “With the original SHERLOCK, we were detecting a single molecule in a microliter, but now we can achieve 100-fold greater sensitivity,” explained co-first author Omar Abudayyeh, an MIT graduate student in Zhang’s lab at Broad. “That’s especially important for applications like detecting cell-free tumor DNA in blood samples, where the concentration of your target might be extremely low. This next generation of features help make SHERLOCK a more precise system.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The authors have made their reagents available to the academic community through Addgene and their software tools can be accessed via the Zhang lab website and GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This study was supported in part by the National Institutes of Health and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency.&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>Mechanical engineering researchers are developing new and innovative ways to improve health care. </description>
     <pubDate>Fri, 02 Feb 2018 14:15:01 -0500</pubDate>

 <guid isPermaLink="true">http://news.mit.edu/2018/understanding-and-treating-disease-MIT-mechanical-engineering-0202</guid>
<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In 2006, a discovery opened up a new world of possibility for treating diseases. For the first time, researchers created stem cells without using embryos. Adult skin cells were reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem cells, or iPSCs, that could differentiate into specialized cells for use in almost any part of the body — from the liver to the heart or brain, and everywhere in between. Areas of the body damaged by disease could be made healthy again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But after more than a decade of research on iPSCs, the process of creating them is still incredibly inefficient. “We have been puzzled that after 10 years of intense research in that direction, the efficiency of iPSC reprogramming is still only about 0.1 percent,” says Associate Professor Domitilla Del Vecchio. “It’s not really at the point that you can use it for clinical purposes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Del Vecchio and her colleagues are hoping to change that. Currently, researchers develop iPSCs by delivering synthetic DNA to the nucleus of a somatic cell, such as a skin cell. This synthetic DNA produces high levels of select proteins — known as transcription factors — with the aim of “pushing” the somatic cell to reprogram into a stem cell. But overloading a cell with such a high level of transcription factors leads to a highly inefficient process. “If you have a mechanical system, such as a car or a robotic manipulator, and you give it an arbitrary push, you should not expect that the system will end up exactly in the configuration you want,” says Del Vecchio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fix this problem, Del Vecchio and her team are adding accelerators and brakes to the process. Using mathematical analysis, they can demonstrate that with an appropriate balance the pluripotent stem cell state can be reached. With the help of small molecules, the synthetic DNA delivered via a virus can produce tunable levels of transcription factors based on a target configuration. This method — called a synthetic genetic feedback controller — can be used to steer the concentration of transcription factors in the cell to the point at which it can become a stem cell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The applications of Del Vecchio’s work may have far-reaching implications for the way diseases are treated. Researchers could quickly create healthy heart cells for patients with a heart condition or beta cells for diabetic patients.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Del Vecchio’s eyes light up when discussing the possibilities. “It’s clearly high risk,” she admits. “But we want to proceed in this direction because if it works, it will be highly impactful for society and hence extremely rewarding for us.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Giving doctors the ability to quickly create stem cells could change the way many diseases are treated. The research Del Vecchio’s team is conducting represents just one example of how mechanical engineering researchers across a diverse range of specialties are developing new and innovative ways to deepen our understanding of disease and unlock new therapies to treat it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diagnosing disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding disease starts with the cell. Assistant Professor Ming Guo, who serves as the d’Arbeloff Career Development Professor, is interested in decoding the differences between the mechanical properties of a healthy cell and a diseased cell as a way to develop a diagnostic tool. “Just by looking at a healthy cell compared to a diseased cell, you can tell that they’re different mechanically,” says Guo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stiffness in particular is a key trait in distinguishing what kind of disease a cell has — for example cancer cells have been shown to be soft while asthma cells are often stiff. Currently, this information is probed by contact-only methods such as atomic force microscopes or optical tweezers, which use either a mechanical tip or a focused laser beam on a patient’s tissue to measure cell properties. Guo and his colleagues have now developed a safer, less invasive method of analyzing the mechanics of a cell to help formulate a diagnosis by simply taking a small sample of cells and watching them using a standard optical microscope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We came up with the method by simply observing the movement of organelles in the cell,” says Guo. The team took videos of cells under a microscope. They tracked the movements of individual organelles or particles within the cell at frequencies of 10 frames per second and higher. Then, by plugging the value of these movements into a generalized form of the Stokes-Einstein equation, they were able to calculate the exact stiffness of a cell.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We found that high frequency fluctuation can help us gauge cell stiffness and understand its mechanics,” says Guo. Understanding these mechanical properties can help doctors diagnose diseases on the spot. Guo has begun collaborating with doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital on applying this method to cancer and asthma cells. The hope is that doctors and researchers can test drug efficacy by measuring a cell’s mechanics before and after treatment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Tracking disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While improving diagnostic methods could help catch a disease early, tracking how diseases grow could be key to developing new therapeutic interventions. Roger Kamm, the Cecil and Ida Green Distinguished Professor, and his lab use a device that’s roughly the size of a quarter to track tumor cells as they leave the vascular network and eventually grow into tumors. These tiny microfluidic devices can help us understand how cancer metastasizes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“We’ve developed a 3-D vascularized network in which we can track cancer cells inside a capillary,” says Kamm. “It’s about understanding how cell populations interact. We can watch the tumor cells escape from the vessel to invade the surrounding tissue.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The microfluidic device consists of two media channels on either side with 3-D hydrogel in the center. The gel is seeded with endothelial cells that form capillaries where the tumor cells are introduced. From there, Kamm and his team use microscopic imaging to watch every single movement the tumor cell makes. From intravasation — when a cancer cell enters the bloodstream — to extravasation — when a tumor cell leaves the blood stream and becomes metastatic — the cell’s path is studied with painstaking precision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Using microfluidics, we can follow this process over time,” explains Kamm. “After the cell enters the metastatic organ, we can see how a single tumor cell starts to multiply over days and how it begins to form a metastatic tumor.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microfluidic devices allow Kamm to analyze the forces that inform the cancer cell’s behavior. Understanding whether tumor cells push or pull when they leave the capillary and the force interactions between endothelial cells and tumor cells represent potential therapeutic targets for preventing or minimizing metastasis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We can look at all these different tumor cell lines, treat the different cells, and see how that affects the rate at which the tumor cells escape from the vasculature and grow,” says Kamm. This knowledge could open up new opportunities in treating cancer and even developing new immunotherapies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treating disease &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Armed with more knowledge of how diseases grow and spread, researchers are better able to develop new ways to treat, and in some cases cure, disease. Among them is Assistant Professor Ellen Roche, who is taking a unique dual approach to treating heart disease using both mechanical and biological therapies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The idea is to mechanically assist the heart,” says Roche, who also serves as Helmholtz Career Development Professor at MIT’s Institute for Medical Engineering and Science. “Rather than take over its function we just assist and augment it using a biomimetic approach.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roche uses new techniques like soft robotics to develop devices that mimic both the tissue properties and the motion of the heart. One such device is a sleeve that wraps around the heart to assist with pumping. Soft robots like this sleeve use elastomeric materials and fluidic actuation to mimic an organ’s movement. “By smartly designing simple fluidics channels and reinforcing soft materials in just the right way, you can achieve very complex motion with just elastomeric changes, and pressurized air or water,” says Roche.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While working on mechanical therapies to treat things like congenital heart disease and heart attacks, Roche is also looking at how biological therapies can help in treating these diseases. She and her team are developing smart devices that provide localized drug delivery instead of systemic drug delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“One of my main goals is to combine these mechanical and biological therapies and see how they interplay with each other,” says Roche. Understanding how these different therapies interact could help determine the best timing sequence for maximum efficacy. With the help of collaborators in the cardiac surgery group at Boston Children’s Hospital, Roche is creating and testing models for these therapies. “We really want to see if we can treat disease and recover function using polytherapy rather than just a mechanical or biological approach.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rehabilitation from disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In instances when disease is not detected or treated in time, researchers are developing tools that assist in the recovery process. From optimizing the design of prosthetic feet or building cheaper wheelchairs, mechanical engineers are finding ways to improve the quality of life for those living with the aftermath of disease. This work also includes tools and devices that can be used in physical rehabilitation. One such tool is the MIT-MANUS — a robot developed by Professor Neville Hogan to help stroke victims recover and regain mobility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They say no two snowflakes are alike, well no two stroke patients are alike either,” says Hogan. “That makes the problem spectacularly complicated.” Hogan has collaborated with neurologists and neuroscientists on understanding the process of recovery and basic motor control in the brain. He used this knowledge to develop robots that interact with stroke patients and help them regain control of their movements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIT-MANUS was originally designed to help restore motor function in stroke patients’ shoulders and elbows. Patients strap their forearm into a brace attached to a robotic arm and grasp onto a controller connected to a video screen. On the screen, a video game provides patients with prompts to move their arm and wrist. If the patient is unable to fully move their arm on their own, MIT-MANUS provides guidance and assists their movements. The robot then tracks and stores this data for physical therapists and specialists to analyze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In clinical trials of MIT-MANUS we found that there was a reduction of impairment in joints exercised through use of the robot,” says Hogan. Over the years the scope of this robot-aided therapy for stroke victims has grown beyond hands and arms. Hogan and his collaborators have put together a robotic gym that helps deliver localized therapy to various limbs and joints throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s constructing large robots like the MIT-MANUS to help rehabilitate stroke victims, tracking the miniscule movements of organelles in the cell, or using genetic circuits to create stem cells, mechanical engineers are shaping both our fundamental understanding of disease and the way in which doctors approach treatments and therapies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <description>New cancer research initiative eyes individualized treatment for patients.</description>
     <pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2018 14:45:01 -0500</pubDate>

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Details matter — perhaps most noticeably in the fight against cancer. Some patients respond to a given anticancer therapy, and some do not. A new initiative at MIT takes aim at those details, and the name of the game is precision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recently launched MIT Center for Precision Cancer Medicine&amp;nbsp;(CPCM) is housed within MIT’s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research and headed by physician-scientist Michael B. Yaffe, the David H. Koch Professor of Science and professor of biology and biological engineering. The center brings together leading Institute faculty members to focus on key research themes to accelerate the clinical translation of novel cancer discoveries, treatments, and technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engineering approaches to the clinic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While other institutions have begun efforts in precision medicine as well, the MIT Center for Precision Cancer Medicine stands out for using engineering approaches to solve complex clinical challenges in cancer treatment that are rooted in biology. In particular, the CPCM combines understandings of biological circuitry — along with engineering, computational, and mathematical techniques (as well as genomic ones) — to focus on signaling networks and pathways that are aberrantly regulated in cancer cells. This strategy is supported by the fact that most state-of-the-art molecularly targeted cancer therapies are focused on these key pathways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its core, the CPCM is driven by both internal and external collaboration, and is devoted to translational research to help the substantial number of patients who do not respond well to traditional cancer therapies — for example, those with triple-negative breast cancer, ovarian cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, or advanced prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To improve outcomes for these patients, CPCM investigators are focused on four key areas of research. First among these is identifying and targeting the processes, signals, and mechanisms that determine an individual patient’s response to chemotherapy. Recent discoveries by CPCM researchers include mechanisms that cancer cells use to repair chemotherapy damage that should have killed them, to hide from drugs in protected “niches” in the body, or to grow when and where they should not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CPCM members are also working on a second research pillar, which involves finding ways to use existing FDA-approved cancer drugs more effectively, particularly in carefully designed combinations. Combination therapies are currently used in the clinic to treat some cancers, yet the discovery process for these has been largely empirical. By contrast, CPCM investigators are integrating their knowledge of cancer biology, understandings of drugs’ mechanisms of action, and sophisticated analytical techniques, to identify or design specific combinations that work synergistically to disarm and then destroy cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We believe we can significantly alter cancer patients’ outcomes by determining the right combination of therapies and the right sequence of drugs for the right patients,” says Yaffe. “We’re also concentrating on innovative ways to give these drugs, like time-staggered dosages and nanoparticle delivery.” He notes that, as part of their analyses of drugs and combination regimens currently administered in the clinic, CPCM members expect to identify combinations of drugs that are not as efficacious when given simultaneously as when given sequentially, at specific intervals. Yaffe stresses that these will be important findings that could help reduce the toxicity of treatment by not exposing people to multiple drug toxicities at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In parallel with their efforts to use existing 
00006000
drugs more effectively, CPCM investigators are also working to identify compounds, materials, and approaches that can engage key “undruggable” genetic and molecular targets and disrupt processes driving drug resistance. The “undruggable” label often refers to the fact that a target protein or molecule lacks a site to which drugs can bind, and thus is not considered a good drug target by the pharmaceutical industry. However, using novel chemistry approaches, CPCM researchers have made early inroads against several such high-value cancer targets, including specific transcription factors and RNA-binding proteins. The center will continue and expand these efforts as the third part of its research platform, including collaborations with industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the fourth component of the CPCM’s efforts will be harnessing MIT’s particular expertise in big data analysis and tools to begin new and expedite existing cancer research efforts. For example, the researchers plan to use data analytics to identify selective panels of biomarkers that can be used to prioritize which of their drug combinations, treatment protocols, and formulations are best suited to a particular patient’s tumor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting discoveries out the door&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Patients will be the ultimate beneficiaries of the work of the new MIT Center for Precision Cancer Medicine,” says Tyler Jacks, director of the Koch Institute and the David H. Koch Professor of Biology. “This research is, by its nature, imminently and rapidly translatable. By concentrating efforts on which patients will benefit from particular existing drugs or combinations of drugs, there is a relatively small step from laboratory to a treatment that is benefitting a cancer patient.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While work on combinations of approved therapies, like that at the CPCM, may be more rapidly translatable than other cancer research, it can be challenging for industry to pursue, particularly when those drugs hail from multiple companies. Overcoming this disjuncture is one of the goals behind the establishment of the MIT Center for Precision Cancer Medicine, which was made possible by a generous gift from an anonymous donor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yaffe and his CPCM colleagues are committed to finding viable routes to move their cancer research into the clinic, particularly through collaborations between CPCM members, hospitals, and industry. Logistically, this means more work for the center’s research groups, including advanced laboratory and preclinical studies, safety and scale-up studies, and clinical-grade manufacturing, as well as staff to carry it out. Woven into these efforts, CPCM investigators will tap into MIT’s celebrated tradition of entrepreneurship and, even more so, the Institute’s expanding network of clinical collaborators. The philanthropic investment behind the center will provide stable financial support for the researchers’ endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The new hub in town&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to supporting the research of member investigators, the CPCM offers a robust training ground for young engineers and scientists interested in precision medicine. Moreover, it will serve as the hub of precision cancer medicine research at MIT and beyond, connecting with researchers across the MIT campus and partnering with clinical investigators in Greater Boston’s noted health care centers and around the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five outstanding cancer researchers make up the center’s founding faculty:&lt;/p&gt;

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Assistant Professor Robin Wolfe Scheffler of MIT’s Program in Science, Technology, and Society (STS) has been awarded the 2018 James A. (1945) and Ruth Levitan Prize in the Humanities. The prestigious award comes with&amp;nbsp;a $30,000 grant that will support his research into Boston’s biotechnology industry.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“Robin’s research will not only deepen our understanding of the development of the biotech industry in Greater Boston,” said Melissa Nobles, the Kenan Sahin Dean of MIT’s School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences. “It will also reveal insights into the ways that human values, community action, and public policy converge to shape technological innovation more generally.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scheffler, the Leo Marx Career Development Professor in the History and Culture of Science and Technology, recently completed his first book, “A Contagious Cause: The Search for Cancer Viruses and the Growth of American Biomedicine”&amp;nbsp;(University of Chicago Press), which details the history of cancer virus research and its impact on the modern biological sciences. He was notified of the award by Nobles in early December.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The Kendall Square model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Scheffler says he&amp;nbsp;plans to use the Levitan Prize to explore whether there is a formula for success behind the growth of the local biotech industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If so, what are the ingredients? How important was MIT? How important was the regulatory framework? How much can be planned, and how much is serendipity? Can Kendall Square be replicated?” he says. “These are some of big questions I hope my research will help to answer.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Scheffler says biotech firms tended to cluster in tradtionally&amp;nbsp;industrial areas like Kendall Square, with clusters of&amp;nbsp;factory buildings that provided&amp;nbsp;open spaces for changing lab arrangements, solid floors, and high ceilings — all ideal for biotechnology research.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But he notes that Greater Boston also offered a more crucial resource: people. That included&amp;nbsp;not just cutting-edge researchers but also the technical workers and clerical staff who work in the area’s universities and hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s not just the ideas and technical innovations,” Scheffler says. “It’s also the people. A successful industry requires people with specific skills in order to flourish, and many of those people already lived here.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right place, right time, right archives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To date, histories of the biotech industry have tended to center on San Francisco, not only because the Bay Area is home to some of the industry’s major companies but also because the archives of many important Bay Area researchers, institutions, and firms have long been available to the public, Scheffler says.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Greater Boston had lacked such resources until recently. Now, libraries at MIT, Harvard University, the University of Massachusetts, and elsewhere have built a critical mass of archival material. One archive that has proven vital to the early stages of Scheffler’s work is the Recombinant DNA History Collection, held by the MIT Libraries and compiled by the late Charles Weiner, a professor of the history of science and technology at MIT.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition, Scheffler says many key players in the early biotech industry still live in and around Cambridge, and he plans to embark on a series of oral histories to enrich the more linear narrative presented by the archives.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“It’s just incredible timing,” he says. “If I had begun the project 10 years ago, the archives wouldn’t have been available. But if I started any later, I might have missed the chance to interview many of the people who were involved in the industry at its very beginning.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;A jumpstart from the Levitan Prize&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Scheffler says the Levitan Prize also comes at the perfect time. “It’s thrilling to receive this award, particularly at the very beginning of a project,” he says. “This research is going to require long hours in the archives and conducting interviews, so support at this early stage jumpstarts the whole endeavor.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scheffler says he plans to interview not just pioneering researchers and company founders, but also the political leaders, day-to-day lab technicians, and citizen activists involved in biotech. Casting such a wide net will lead to a history that accounts for conflicts, contradictions, and dead ends as well as the industry’s successes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“I would be so grateful if this award served as a beacon for those people whose experiences and views might otherwise not be included in official records,” he says, such as part-time technical workers, activists, and Kendall Square residents.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Levitan Prize from MIT SHASS is awarded annually to support innovative and creative scholarship in the humanities. Established through a gift from the late James A. Levitan, a 1945 MIT graduate in chemistry who was also a member of the MIT Corporation, the prize&amp;nbsp;was first awarded in 1990.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dmse.mit.edu/faculty/profile/anikeeva&quot;&gt;Polina Anikeeva&lt;/a&gt;, the Class of 1942 Associate Professor in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering and associate director of the Research Laboratory of Electronics, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://mcgovern.mit.edu/principal-investigators/feng-zhang&quot;&gt;Feng Zhang&lt;/a&gt;, the James and Patricia Poitras ’63 Professor in Neuroscience at the McGovern Institute, have each been awarded a 2018 Vilcek Prize for Creative Promise in Biomedical Science. Awarded annually by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vilcek.org/&quot;&gt;Vilcek Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, the $50,000 prizes recognize younger immigrants who have demonstrated exceptional promise early in their careers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The Vilcek Prizes were established in appreciation of the immigrants who chose to dedicate their vision and talent to bettering American society,” says Rick Kinsel, president of the Vilcek Foundation. “This year’s prizewinners honor and continue that legacy with works of astounding, revolutionary importance.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Polina Anikeeva, who was born in the former Soviet Union, earned her PhD in materials science and engineering at MIT in 2009 and now runs her own bioelectronics lab in the same department focused on the development of materials and devices that enable recording and manipulation of signaling processes within the nervous system. The Vilcek Foundation recognizes Anikeeva for “fashioning ingenious solutions to long-standing challenges in biomedical engineering” including the design of therapeutic devices for conditions such as Parkinson’s disease and spinal cord injury.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Feng Zhang, who is also a core member of the Broad Institute and an associate professor in the departments of Brain and Cognitive Sciences and Biological Engineering, is being recognized for his role in advancing optogenetics (a method for controlling brain activity with light) and developing molecular tools to edit the genome. Thanks to his leadership in inventing precise and efficient gene-editing technologies using CRISPR, Zhang&#039;s work has resulted in a &quot;growing array of applications, such as uncovering the genetic underpinnings of diseases, ushering in gene therapies to cure heritable diseases, and improving agriculture.&quot;&amp;nbsp;Zhang’s family immigrated to the United States from China when he was 11 years of age.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anikeeva and Zhang will be among eight Vilcek prizewinners honored at an awards gala in New York City in April 2018.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Vilcek Foundation was established in 2000 by Jan and Marica Vilcek, immigrants from the former Czechoslovakia. The mission of the foundation, to honor the contributions of immigrants to the United States and to foster appreciation of the arts and sciences, was inspired by the couple’s respective careers in biomedical science and art history, as well as their personal experiences and appreciation of the opportunities they received as newcomers to this country.&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>Department of Biology kicks off IAP seminar series with a lecture by synthetic-biology visionary George Church.</description>
     <pubDate>Wed, 31 Jan 2018 13:00:01 -0500</pubDate>

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the invention of genome sequencing technology more than three decades ago, we can now read the genetic blueprint of virtually any organism. After the ability to read came the ability to edit — adding, subtracting, and eventually altering DNA wherever we saw fit. And yet, for &lt;a href=&quot;http://arep.med.harvard.edu/gmc/&quot;&gt;George Church&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at Harvard Medical School, associate member of the Broad Institute, and founding core faculty and lead for synthetic biology at the Wyss Institute — who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC345422/&quot;&gt;co-pioneered direct genome sequencing&lt;/a&gt; in 1984 — the ultimate goal is not just to read and edit, but also to write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if you could engineer a cell resistant to all viruses, even the ones it hadn’t yet encountered? What if you could grow your own liver in a pig to replace the faulty one you were born with? What if you could grow an entire brain in a dish? In his lecture on Jan. 24 — which opened the Department of Biology’s Independent Activities Period (IAP) seminar series, &lt;a href=&quot;http://student.mit.edu/searchiap/iap-9289af8d5916df0901591dcb6f2b0135.html&quot;&gt;Biology at Transformative Frontiers&lt;/a&gt; — Church promised all this and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We began by dividing the Biology IAP events into two tracks: one related to careers in academia and another equivalent track for industry,” says Jing-Ke Weng, assistant professor and IAP faculty coordinator for the department. “But then it became clear that George Church, Patrick Brown, and other speakers we hoped to invite blurred the boundaries between those two tracks. The Biology at Transformative Frontiers seminar series became about the interface of these trajectories, and how transferring technologies from lab bench to market is altering society as we know it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The seminar series is a staple in the Department of Biology’s IAP program, but during the past several years it has been oriented more toward quantitative biology. Weng recalls these talks as being relegated to the academic sphere, and wanted to show students that the lines between academia, industry, and scientific communication are actually quite porous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We chose George Church to kick off the series because he’s been in synthetic biology for a long time, and continues to have a successful academic career even while starting so many companies,” says Weng.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Church’s genomic sequencing methods inspired the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.genome.gov/10001772/all-about-the--human-genome-project-hgp/&quot;&gt;Human Genome Project&lt;/a&gt; in 1984 and resulted in the first commercial genome sequence (the bacterium&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Helicobacter pylori&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;10 years later. He also serves as the director of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://pgp.med.harvard.edu/&quot;&gt;Personal&amp;nbsp;Genome Project&lt;/a&gt;, the “Wikipedia” of open-access human genomic data. Beyond these ventures, he’s known for his work on barcoding, DNA assembly from chips, genome editing, and stem cell engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He’s also the same George Church who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsci.com/church-george-church&quot;&gt;converted the boo&lt;/a&gt;k he co-authored with Ed Regis, &quot;Regenesis: How Synthetic Biology Will Reinvent Nature and Ourselves,&quot; into a four-letter code based on the four DNA nucleotides (A, T, C, and G), subsisted on nutrient broth from a lab vendor for an entire year, and dreams of eventually &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newscientist.com/article/2121503-can-we-grow-woolly-mammoths-in-the-lab-george-church-hopes-so/&quot;&gt;resurrecting woolly mammoths&lt;/a&gt;. He’s being featured in an upcoming Netflix Original documentary, so when he arrived at the Stata Center to give his lecture last week he was trailed by a camera crew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Church, the transformative technologies that initially allowed us to read and edit DNA have grown exponentially in recent years with the invention of &lt;a href=&quot;https://patents.google.com/patent/US4942124A&quot;&gt;molecular multiplexing&lt;/a&gt; and CRISPR-Cas9 (think Moore’s Law but even more exaggerated). But there’s always room for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There’s been a little obsession with CRISPR-Cas9s and other CRISPRs,” said Church. “Everybody is saying how great it is, but it’s important to say what’s wrong with it as well, because that tells us where we’re going next and how to improve on it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He outlined several of his own collaborations, including those aimed at devising more precise methods of genome editing, one resulting in &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/342/6156/357&quot;&gt;321 changes&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt; genome — the largest change in any genome yet — rendering the bacterium resistant to all viruses, even those it had not yet come into contact with. The next step? Making similarly widespread changes in plants, animals, and eventually perhaps even human tissue. In fact, Church and his team have set their sights on combatting the global transplantation crisis with humanlike organs grown in animals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Since the dawn of transplantation as a medical practice, we’ve had to use either identical twins or rare matches that are very compatible immunologically, because we couldn’t engineer the donor or the recipient,” said Church.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since it’s clearly unethical to engineer human donors, Church
00006000
 reasoned, why not engineer animals with compatible organs instead? Pigs, to be exact, since most of their organs are comparable in size and function to our own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is an old dream; I didn’t originate it,” said Church. “It started about 20 years ago, and the pioneers of this field worked on it for a while, but dropped it largely because the number of changes to the genome were daunting, and there was a concern that the viruses all pigs make — retroviruses — would be released and infect the immunocompromised organ recipient.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Church and his team successfully &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/350/6264/1101&quot;&gt;disrupted 62 of these retroviruses&lt;/a&gt; in pig cells back in 2015, and in 2017 they &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/357/6357/1303&quot;&gt;used these cells&lt;/a&gt; to generate living, healthy pigs. Today, the pigs are thriving and rearing piglets of their own. Church is also considering the prospect of growing augmented organs in pigs for human transplantation, perhaps designing pathogen-, cancer-, and age-resistant organs suitable for cryopreservation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hopefully we’ll be doing nonhuman primate trials within a couple of years, and then almost immediately after that human trials,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another possibility, rather than cultivating organs in animals for transplant, is to generate them in a dish. A subset of Church’s team is working on growing from scratch what is arguably the most complicated organ of all, the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This requires differentiating multiple types of cells in the same dish so they can interact with each other to form the complex systems of communication characteristic of the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early attempts at fashioning brain organoids often lacked capillaries to distribute oxygen and nutrients (roughly one capillary for each of the 86 billion neurons in the human brain). However, thanks to their new human transcription factor library, Church and colleagues have &lt;a href=&quot;https://wyss.harvard.edu/technology/engineering-organoids-to-recapitulate-brain-tissue/&quot;&gt;begun to generate&lt;/a&gt; the cell types necessary to create such capillaries, plus the scaffolding needed to promote the three-dimensional organization of these and additional brain structures. Church and his team have not only successfully integrated the structures with one another, but have also created an algorithm that spits out the list of molecular ingredients required to generate each cell type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Church noted these &lt;em&gt;de novo&lt;/em&gt; organoids are extremely useful in determining which genetic variants are responsible for certain diseases. For instance, you could sequence a patient’s genome and then create an entire organoid with the mutation in question to test whether it was the root cause of the condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m still stunned by the breadth of projects and approaches that he’s running simultaneously,” says Emma Kowal, a second-year graduate student, member of Weng’s planning committee, and a former researcher in Church’s lab. “The seminar series is called Biology at Transformative Frontiers, and George is very much a visionary, so we thought it would be a great way to start things off.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://student.mit.edu/searchiap/iap-9289af8d5916df0901591dcb6f2b0135.html&quot;&gt;four-part series&lt;/a&gt; also features Melissa Moore, chief scientific officer of the Moderna Therapeutics mRNA Research Platform, Jay Bradner, president of the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, and Patrick Brown, CEO and founder of Impossible Foods.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>Platform connects individual pieces of lab equipment, compiles data in the cloud for speedier, more accurate research.</description>

 <guid isPermaLink="true">http://news.mit.edu/2018/startup-tetrascience-makes-labs-smarter-0125</guid>
<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Although Internet-connected “smart” devices have in recent years penetrated numerous industries and private homes, the technological phenomenon has left the research lab largely untouched. Spreadsheets, individual software programs, and even pens and paper remain standard tools for recording and sharing data in academic and industry labs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;TetraScience, co-founded by Spin Wang SM ’15, a graduate of electrical engineering and computer science,&amp;nbsp;has developed a data-integration platform that connects disparate types of lab equipment and software systems, in-house and at outsourced drug developers and manufacturers. It then unites the data from all these sources in the cloud for speedier and more accurate research, cost savings, and other benefits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Software and hardware systems [in labs] cannot communicate with each other in a consistent way,” says Wang, TetraScience’s chief technology officer, who co-founded the startup with former Harvard University postdocs Salvatore Savo and Alok Tayi. “Data flows through systems in a very fragmented manner and there are a lot of siloed data sets [created] in the life sciences. Humans must manually copy and paste information or write it down on paper, [which] is a lengthy manual process that’s error prone.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;TetraScience has developed an Internet of Things (IoT) hub that plugs into most lab equipment, including freezers, ovens, incubators, scales, pH meters, syringe pumps, and autoclaves. The hub can also continuously collect relevant data — such as humidity, temperature, gas concentration and oxygen levels, vibration, light intensity, and mass air flow — and shoot it to TetraScience’s centralized data-integration platform in the cloud. TetraScience also has custom integration methods for more complicated instruments and software.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the cloud dashboard, researchers can monitor equipment in real time and set alerts if any equipment deviates from ideal conditions. Data appears as charts, graphs, percentages, and numbers — somewhat resembling the easily readable Google Analytics dashboard. Equipment can be tracked for usage and efficiency over time to determine if, say, a freezer is slowly warming and compromising samples. Researchers can also comb through scores of archived data, all located in one place.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our technology is establishing a ‘data highway’ system between different entities, software and hardware, within life sciences labs. We make facilitating data seamless, faster, more accurate, and more efficient,” says Wang, who was named to this year’s &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; 30 Under 30 list of innovators for his work with TetraScience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More than 70 major pharmaceutical and biotech firms, including many in Cambridge, Massachusetts, use the platform. Numerous labs at MIT and Harvard are users, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pain in the lab&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Wang and his TetraScience co-founders, building their smart solution was personal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a Cornell University undergraduate, Wang worked in the Cornell Semiconducting RF Lab&amp;nbsp;on high-energy physics research. Frustrated by the time and effort required to manually record data, he developed his own system that connected and controlled more than 10 instruments, such as a signal generator, power meter, frequency counter, and power amplifier.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Years later, as an MIT master’s student studying microelectromechanical systems, Wang worked on sensing technologies and processing of radio frequency signals under the guidance of Professor Dana Weinstein, now at Purdue University. During his final year, he wound up at the MIT Media Lab, working on a 3-D printing project with Tayi, who had spent his academic career toiling away in materials science, chemistry, and other labs. Tayi and Savo were already conducting market research around potential opportunities for IoT in labs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All three bonded over a shared dislike for data-collecting tools that have remained relatively unchanged in labs for a half-century. “We felt the pain of manually tracking data and not having a consistent interface for all our equipment,” Wang says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is especially troublesome at scale. Large pharmaceutical or biotechnology firms, for instance, can have several hundreds or thousands of instruments, all with different hardware running on different software. Humans must record data and input it manually into dozens of separate recording systems, which leads to errors. People also must be physically in a lab to control experiments. Smart labs were the new frontier, Wang, Savo, and Tayi agreed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2014, the three launched TetraScience to build a platform that connected equipment and pooled data into a single place in the cloud —&amp;nbsp;similar to the one Wang created at Cornell, but more advanced. Back then, they used a slightly modified Raspberry Pi as their “hub,” while they refined their software and hardware.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For early-stage startup advice, the startup turned to the Industrial Liaison Program and MIT’s Venture Mentoring Service, and leveraged MIT’s vast alumni network for feedback on their technology and business plan. “We definitely benefited from MIT,” Wang says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saving time and money&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An early trial for the platform was with the Media Lab, where researchers used the platform to monitor not equipment, but beehives. The researchers were studying how hives could be implemented into building infrastructure and how design and materials could promote bee health. As bees are sensitive to changes in environment, the researchers needed to constantly monitor temperature and humidity around hives over several months, which would be challenging if done manually.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using TetraScience’s platform, the researchers were captured all the necessary data for their project, without suiting up and approaching all the hives daily — saving “hundreds of hours … and 686 bee stings,” according to the startup. Testing at MIT, Wang says, “helped us gain an understanding of the industry and value proposition.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From there, the TetraScience platform found its way into more biotech companies and into more than 60 percent of the world’s top 20 pharmaceutical companies, according to the startup. Benefits of today’s TetraScience platform include speeding up research, improving compliance, producing better-quality data and, ultimately, saving millions of dollars and countless hours of work, Wang says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Numerous &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tetrascience.com/case-studies&quot;&gt;case studies&lt;/a&gt;, listed on the startup’s webpage, showcase the platform’s efficacy and value at major pharmaceutical firms and cancer research centers, and at Harvard and MIT.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, in the final stages of approval of a multibillion-dollar drug, a large pharmaceutical firm conducted an accelerated lifetime test, where any prolonged deviation from preset conditions would require restarting the experiment, at the cost of millions of dollars, weeks of unusable data, and delayed commercialization. Within a few weeks of the test’s conclusion, a major deviation in one experiment occurred late at night. Within seconds, according to the study, TetraScience’s platform detected the deviation and alerted scientists, who caught it immediately, stopping any significant damage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The platform also offers benefits for determining equipment efficiency and usage. In a 2017 case study with another pharmaceutical firm, TetraScience monitored 70 pieces of equipment. The startup flagged 23 instruments as “heavily underused.” The firm used that data to reduce service contracts for 14 instruments and sell nine instruments, leading to improved efficiency and hundreds of thousands of dollars in savings that could be put toward more research and development.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although the startup’s focus is on pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, the platform could also be used in oil and gas, brewing, and food and chemistry industries to see similar benefits. “Those industries all use similar instruments [as life science labs] and produce the same kind of data, such as monitoring the pH of beer, so we will get into those industries in the future,” Wang says.&lt;/p&gt;

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A type of virus that dominates water samples taken from the world’s oceans has long escaped analysis because it has characteristics that standard tests can’t detect. However, researchers at MIT and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine have now managed to isolate and study representatives of these elusive viruses, which provide a key missing link in virus evolution and play an important role in regulating bacterial populations, as a new study reports.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Viruses are the main predators of bacteria, and the findings suggest that the current view of bacterial virus diversity has a major blind spot. These conclusions have emerged through detailed analysis of marine samples led by MIT postdoc Kathryn Kauffman, professor of civil and environmental engineering Martin Polz, professor Libusha Kelly of Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and nine others. The results are being reported this week in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The newly identified viruses lack the “tail” found on most catalogued and sequenced bacterial viruses, and have several other unusual properties that have led to their being missed by previous studies. To honor that fact, the researchers named this new group the &lt;em&gt;Autolykiviridae&lt;/em&gt; — after a character from Greek mythology who was storied for being difficult to catch. And, unlike typical viruses that prey on just one or two types of bacteria, these tailless varieties can infect dozens of different types, often of different species, underscoring their ecological relevance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This research “opens new avenues for furthering our understanding of the roles of viruses in the ocean,” says Jed Fuhrman, the McCulloch-Crosby Chair of Marine Biology at the University of Southern California, who was not involved in this work. “In a practical sense, it also shows how we need to alter some commonly used methods in order to capture these kinds of viruses for various studies,” he says. “I’d say it is an important advance in the field.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Current environmental models of virus-bacteria interactions are based on the well-studied tailed viruses, Kauffman explains, so they may be missing important aspects of the interactions taking place in nature.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We already knew that viruses are very important there,” Kauffman says, referring to the surface ocean, where the researchers’ samples were drawn, and where about 10 million viruses are found in every milliliter of water. Polz says that while “most of the viruses studied in labs have tails, most of those in the ocean don’t.” So the team decided to study one subset of tailless viruses, which infects a group of bacteria called &lt;em&gt;Vibrio&lt;/em&gt;. After extensive tests, they found “that some of these were infecting unusually large numbers of hosts,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After sequencing representatives of the &lt;em&gt;Autolykiviridae&lt;/em&gt;, the researchers found “their genomes were quite different from other viruses,” Polz says. For one thing, their genomes are very short: about 10,000 bases, compared to the typical 40,000-50,000 for tailed viruses. “When we found that, we were surprised,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With the new sequence information, the researchers were able to comb through databases and found that such viruses exist in many places. The research also showed that these viruses tend to be underrepresented in databases because of the ways samples are typically handled in labs. The methods the team developed to obtain these viruses from environmental samples could help researchers avoid such losses of information in the future. In addition, Kauffman says, typically the way researchers test for viral activity is by infecting bacteria with the viral sample and then checking the samples a day later to look for signs that patches of the bacteria have been killed off. But these particular nontailed viruses often act more slowly, and the killed-off regions don’t show up until several days have passed — so their presence was never noticed in most studies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new group of viruses may especially be widespread. “We don’t think it’s ocean-specific at all,” Polz says. For example, the viruses may even be prevalent in the human biome, and they may play roles in major biogeochemical cycles, he says, such as the cycling of carbon.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another important aspect of theses findings is that the &lt;em&gt;Autolykiviridae&lt;/em&gt; were shown to be &amp;nbsp;members of an ancient viral lineage that is defined by specific types of capsids, the protein shell encasing the viral DNA. Though this lineage is known to be very diverse in animals and protists — and includes viruses such as the adenoviruses that infect humans, and the giant viruses that infect algae — very few viruses of this kind have been found to infect bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This work substantially changes the existing ideas on the composition of the ocean virome by showing that the content of small, tailless viruses … is comparable to that of the tailed viruses … that are currently thought to dominate the virosphere,” says Eugene V. Koonin, a senior investigator at the National Institutes of Health, who was not involved in this research. “This work is important also for understanding the evolution of the virus world because it shows that viruses related to the most common viruses of eukaryotes (such as adenoviruses, poxviruses, and others), at least in terms of the capsid structure, are much wider-spread in prokaryotes than previously suspected.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Koonin adds, “I further wonder whether the viruses reported here might only represent the tip of the proverbial iceberg, because capsid proteins can be highly diverged in sequence so that many are missed even in sensitive database searches. The findings are also of practical importance because the tailless viruses appear to play a major ecological role in the ocean, being responsible for a substantial fraction of bacteria-killing.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The work was supported by the National Science Foundation and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution’s Ocean Ventures Fund.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microbial communities demonstrate high turnover</title>

    <description>New research provides insight into the behavior of microbial communities in the ocean.</description>

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When Mark Twain famously said “If you don’t like the weather in New England, just wait a few minutes,” he probably didn’t anticipate MIT researchers would apply his remark to their microbial research. But a new study does just that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A team from MIT, using water samples from the New England coast, found that microbial communities are able to form despite rapidly varying conditions in the coastal environment. Biological communities are typically defined as the set of organisms living and interacting in a certain area, carrying out important ecological functions, such as all the organisms in a forest. In the ocean, however, water is constantly moving, making it more difficult to answer the question of what constitutes a community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using novel analytical techniques, the MIT researchers show that communities of interacting microbes form but are short-lived. They reach their peak abundance after only a few days and are subsequently replaced by another community. Following the forest analogy, imagine returning after a week and finding entirely different species of plants and animals populating the same area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This rapid turnover struck the researchers as similar to Twain’s quote: “The good news may be that if you don’t like the microbial community, just wait for a few days,” they quip at the conclusion of their paper, published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We know relatively little about how microbial communities — the assemblage of microbes in the ocean — change over time and space,” says Martin Polz, professor of civil and environmental engineering (CEE) at MIT and corresponding author on the paper. “People have gone out and taken samples in distinct locations
00006000
, so we are getting to know more about the global diversity, but when you go to a particular location and ask, ‘How is it changing over time?’ we actually know relatively little.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fill this void, Polz and the research team collected daily ocean water samples from Canoe Cove in Nahant, Massachusetts, over a three-month period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together, the researchers, including graduate student Brian Cleary of the Broad Institute and MIT&#039;s computational and systems biology program; former CEE postdoc Antonio Martin-Platero; CEE postdoc Kathryn Kauffman; former CEE postdoc Sarah Preheim; Eric Alm, professor of civil and environmental engineering and biological engineering; Polz; and Dennis McGillicuddy of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution analyzed the samples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their analysis the researchers took into account temporal and spatial aspects of water movement, such as from ocean currents. The research was conducted between the summer and fall seasons, and, contrary to what may be expected, the team found that the community formation doesn’t necessarily change as a result of seasonal transitions, but rather follows the every-few-days routine. This is not to say that seasonal changes don’t influence the formation of communities, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Temperature alone is a huge factor in structuring communities, but it’s not enough to go and sample once per season to have an idea of what’s going on in the season,” says Polz. “The community turnover is much faster than that, and this indicates that the ecological conditions are shifting on equally fast time scales since the organisms respond to physical and chemical changes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That the abundance of specific microbes in the community drops sharply after only a few days signals that they may be competing with other microbes for resources to survive. This suggests that while chemistry and physics govern overall community turnover, within communities biological interactions cause even more rapid fluctuations in species abundances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We think the [rapid community changes] are basically set by the ocean physics. We analyzed chemical and physical data and for some of these events we could identify a characteristic period of upwelling, when nutrient rich deep water is transported to the surface and stimulate a certain set of microbes,” says Polz. “We also looked at satellite data, which measures temperature and chlorophyll, and we saw that features developing in the ocean are corresponding with these communities. The physics really sets the chemical and temperature regimes that trigger the blooms of these communities but physical changes probably also terminate them. Because the water is constantly moving, different water bodies mix, and other local features form.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In collaboration with Alm and his lab, the researchers also created a new algorithm to analyze the samples and sequence the genes to get a more complete understanding of the patterns and behavior of the microbial communities. Using the algorithm, Cleary explains, the researchers looked for relationships between microbes based on how they are fluctuating throughout the time series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There are microbes fluctuating around in an environment, but we obviously are not directly observing either the cooperative or competitive interactions between pairs [of microbes], and we aren’t directly observing the low-frequency changes that might correspond to a nutrient regime,” says Cleary. “With our algorithm, we can infer the entire community structure from these fluctuations at different frequency levels.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers’ findings also provide insight into the conditions that more permanent organisms in the region face as the microbial plankton turnover. A comprehensive understanding of microbial behavior in the ocean can inform human health, fisheries, and aquaculture, specifically through monitoring water quality.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This paper represents a significant advance in our knowledge of the forces that mediate community assembly in fluid environments, and provides a wealth of new information to support new hypothesis-driven research into the specific mechanisms that underpin this complex association,” says Jack Gilbert, faculty director of the Microbiome Center at the University of Chicago, who was not involved in this work.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research was funded in part by the National Science Foundation and the United States Department of Energy.&lt;/p&gt;

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Liquid-liquid separation and chemical extraction are key processes in drug manufacturing&amp;nbsp;and many other industries, including oil and gas, fragrances, food, wastewater filtration, and biotechnology.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Three years ago, MIT spinout Zaiput Flow Technologies launched a novel continuous-flow liquid-liquid separator that makes those processes faster, easier, and more efficient. Today, nine pharmaceutical giants and a growing number of academic labs and small companies use the separator.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Having proved its efficacy on Earth, the separator is now being tested as a tool for manufacturing drugs and synthesizing chemicals in outer space.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2015, Zaiput won a Galactic Grant from the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space that allows companies to test technologies on the International Space Station (ISS). On Dec. 15, after two years of development and preparation, Zaiput launched its separator in a SpaceX rocket as part of the CRS-13 cargo resupply mission that will last one month.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As long-duration space travel and extraterrestrial habitation becomes a potential reality, it’s important to find ways to synthesize chemicals for drugs, food, fuels, and other products in space that may be important for those missions, says Zaiput co-founder and CEO Andrea Adamo SM ’03, who co-invented the separator in the lab of Klavs Jensen, the Warren K. Lewis Professor of Chemical Engineering. Notably, Zaiput’s separator, called SEP-10, separates liquids without the need for gravity, which is a trademark of traditional methods.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When people go on deep space explorations, or maybe to Mars, these are multiyear missions,” Adamo says. “But how do you synthesize chemicals for drugs and other products without gravity? We have that answer. Testing our unit in space will show that what we have done on Earth is fully exportable to space.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Results from the ISS experiments will prove that the device indeed functions in zero-gravity, which is basically impossible to verify on Earth. And, they will help the startup refine the device, Adamo says: “MIT strives for excellence and we inherited that model — we’re still striving for excellence.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surface forces&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In traditional liquid-liquid separators, a mixture of two liquids of different densities is fed into a funnel-shaped settling tank. The heavier liquid sinks and can be drained out through a valve, away from the lighter liquid, which stays on top. But the separation process is time-consuming, and some chemicals can decay or become unstable while sitting in the tank.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead of leveraging gravity, Zaiput’s separator uses surface forces to attract or repel a liquid from a membrane. As an example, consider a nonstick pan: Oil spreads on the pan, but water beads up because it has an affinity to bond with the polymer covering the pan, while oil does not.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zaiput’s separator uses the same principle. A mixture of liquids is pumped through a feed tube and travels to a porous polymer membrane. One liquid is drawn to the surface of the membrane, while the other is repelled. An internal mechanical pressure controller maintains a slight pressure differential between one side of the membrane and the other. This differential is just enough to push the attracted liquid through the porous membrane without pushing the repelled one. The attracted liquid then goes out through one tube, while allowing the repelled liquid to flow out through a separate tube. Flow rates range from 0 to 12 milliliters per minute.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you want to use this for a continuous operation in a reliable way, you have to carefully control pressure conditions across membranes,” Adamo says. “You want a little bit of pressure, so the chemical goes through, but not too much to push through the unwanted liquid. The internal controller ensures this happens at all times.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zaiput’s separator also improves chemical extraction, which is different from liquid separation. Imagine working with a mixture of wine and oil. Liquid separation means separating the mixture into individual flows, of wine and oil. Extraction, however, means removing the ethanol chemical from the wine, along with separating the liquids, which is of interest to chemists.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For chemical extraction, a “feed” liquid that contains a target chemical for extraction and a “solvent” — which is incapable of mixing with the feed liquid —&amp;nbsp;are combined in a tube that flows toward the separation device. The solvent captures the target chemical from the feed because the chemical is soluble in it; the separation devices then separate two streams, with the solvent containing the target chemical. In the wine-oil example, the ethanol would be removed by the oil solvent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zaiput units can be equipped with different types of membranes to achieve specific effects, or connected in a series of units.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Importantly, Adamo says, Zaiput’s continuous-flow, membrane-based separator allows for separation of emulsions, whereby small droplets of one liquid end up in the other liquid, never fully separating. “We don’t have that issue, because we don’t need to wait for liquids to settle,” Adamo says. “W
00006000
e are the only technology that provides continuous separation, can readily separate emulsions, and is also designed for safety, so if you’re dealing with explosive or toxic substances, you can process them quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beautifying and scaling up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adamo came to MIT in the early 2000s as a civil engineer. Conducting research at MIT and being exposed to the Institute’s entrepreneurial ecosystem, however, “changed my horizons,” he says. “I wanted to be in a field where I could bring technology to the world through a startup.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Civil engineering had some limits in that regard, so Adamo started experimenting in the fast-moving field of microfluidics, working as a researcher in the lab of Jensen, a pioneer of flow chemistry. Inspired by Jensen’s previous research into surface forces, Adamo began designing a small, membrane-based separation device equipped with a precise pressure controller that maintained exact conditions for separation. This first prototype consisted of two bulky plastic pieces bolted together. “It was really ugly,” Adamo says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But showcasing the prototype to colleagues at MIT, he found that despite its unaesthetic appearance, the device had commercial potential. “The innovation was not just good for the lab, but also for general public,” he says. “I started looking into business propositions.” (So far, the research has also produced &lt;a href=&quot;http://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ie401180t&quot;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.iecr.7b00434&quot;&gt;papers&lt;/a&gt; co-authored by Jensen, Adamo, and other MIT researchers in &lt;em&gt;Industrial &amp;amp; Engineering Chemistry&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Research&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2013, Adamo co-founded Zaiput with partner and Harvard University biochemist Jennifer Baltz, now Zaiput’s chief operating officer, with help from MIT’s Venture Mentoring Service and other MIT services.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The startup designed a far more appealing product. Growing up in Italy, Adamo says, he was always surrounded by beautiful, colorful scenery and objects. He used that background as inspiration for the separator’s design, turning the prototype into a series of handheld, colorful blocks. Lab units are orange; larger units are purple, gold, or lime green. There is also color coding for different devices that are made of different materials.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Customers visit labs and these devices pop out,” Adamo says. “Function is key, but when you take an object in your hands, it has to feel nice. It has to be pleasing to the eye and, in a commercial sense, distinctive.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Currently, Zaiput is developing a production-scale device with a flow rate of 3,000 milliliters per minute, for larger-scale drug manufacturing. The startup is also hoping to more efficiently tackle very complex chemical extractions. Today, this involves repeating chemical extraction processes multiple times in massive columns, about 100 feet high, to ensure as much of the target chemical has been extracted from a liquid. But Zaiput hopes it can do the same with a small system of combined modular units. Additionally, the startup hopes to bring the device to traditional batch-separation users, notably those who still work with settling tanks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The next challenges are bigger-scale development, more complex extraction, and reaching out to traditional users to empower them with new technologies,” Adamo says.&lt;/p&gt;

 <guid isPermaLink="true">http://news.mit.edu/2017/mit-microbiology-graduate-phd-program-celebrates-decade-success-1212</guid>
<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ten years ago, MIT launched the &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.mit.edu/microbiology/&quot;&gt;Microbiology Graduate PhD Program&lt;/a&gt;. Today, it boasts 28 alumni and 33 current students, and offers a broad, interdisciplinary approach to microbial science and engineering. Between five and eight trainees enroll each year and can choose among more than 50 labs spanning 10 departments and divisions — from biology and biological engineering to chemical engineering and physics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many diverse disciplines are rooted in microbiology. Basic scientists use microorganisms as model systems to understand fundamental biological processes. Engineers leverage microorganisms to create new manufacturing processes and energy sources. Even ecologists, biomedical researchers, and earth scientists dedicate their careers to investigating the role of microbes in our ecosystems, on our bodies, and on our planet. In sum, the study of microbiology permeates so many research areas that no single department at MIT could house them all.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea for an interdisciplinary microbiology program first came to Alan Grossman, head of the Department of Biology, while he was &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.mit.edu/getinvolved/science/summer-2017/alan-grossman-shares-lessons-learned-his-lifesaving-gift&quot;&gt;recovering from a heart transplant&lt;/a&gt; back in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There were people scattered all over MIT who were doing microbial science and engineering, but there was no mechanism to connect them or give students outside those departments easy access to the labs,” Grossman says. “I began by talking to a few faculty members in order to gauge general interest, before pitching it to a handful of department heads and forming a committee. Everyone was very excited about it, and it really grew from the ground up.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Committee on Graduate Programs approved his proposal in May 2007, and the first cohort of eight students began in the fall of 2008. &lt;a href=&quot;https://cee.mit.edu/people_individual/martin-f-polz/&quot;&gt;Martin Polz&lt;/a&gt;, co-director since 2015 and professor of civil and environmental engineering, sat on Grossman’s initial committee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“MIT’s program is unique from most other microbiology programs because it’s so interdisciplinary,” Polz says. “Many microbiology programs across the country are associated with medical schools and focused primarily on pathogenesis. The students who apply here really appreciate the breadth of our program, and it has become a fixture at MIT over the years.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cheme.mit.edu/profile/kristala-l-jones-prather/&quot;&gt;Kristala Prather&lt;/a&gt;, co-director since 2013 and professor of chemical engineering, said the program also provides an opportunity to bring life scientists and engineers together to tackle research questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I find there is a difference in the way engineers and scientists approach research problems,” Prather says. “Each approach has rigor, but having both perspectives breeds a richer set of discussions than just hearing from one discipline alone.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the past 10 years, Prather has watched a thriving and diverse community unite, spurred by a common interest in the microbial world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://almlab.mit.edu/nathaniel_chu.html&quot;&gt;Nathaniel Chu&lt;/a&gt;, who matriculated in 2014, said the program allows him to sample different disciplines while still maintaining a close affiliation with his advisor’s home department, Biological Engineering. As part of Eric Alm’s lab, Chu studies the interaction between the gut microbiome and immune system, and how imbalances in that delicate relationship can trigger conditions such as Type 2 diabetes, obesity, and inflammatory bowel disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The program provides flexibility to explore your research interests, and my advisor has given me a lot of space to conceive and manage my own projects,” Chu says. “I’ve been able to interact with a diverse set of individuals within the microbiology circle, including clinical partners, immunologists, geneticists, bioinformaticians, and computational biologists.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://be.mit.edu/directory/jacquin-c-niles&quot;&gt;Jacquin Niles&lt;/a&gt;, incoming co-director, was a junior faculty member in Department of Biological Engineering when Grossman first proposed the idea. He says the students — past and present — are the heart of the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;“A lot has changed over the 10 years the program has been in existence, but the caliber of students has remained consistent,” Niles&amp;nbsp;says. “If I had to emphasize any particular aspect of the program, the students would be numbers one, two, and three. Each generation has been exceptional, and they are all very much on top of their research game.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://biology.mit.edu/people/michael_laub&quot;&gt;Michael Laub&lt;/a&gt;, co-director from 2012 to 2015 and professor of biology, adds that the early students deserve much credit for the program’s success. “They took a chance on a brand-new initiative, and as a result we ended up attracting ambitious, risk-taking, and creative folks who really paved the way for current students,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alumni pursue a variety of careers, ranging from academia to industry. Some join existing institutions or companies. Others start their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Smith PhD ’14 was a member of the second graduating class. Like Chu, he was one of Alm’s advisees, studying networks of gene exchange within the human microbiome, and building statistical models to determine the role of environment in various gut-related diseases. Smith went on to co-found a nonprofit organization known as OpenBiome, harnessing the microbiome to cure recurrent &lt;em&gt;Clostridium difficile&lt;/em&gt; infections. In 2016, he co-founded another company, Finch Therapeutics Group, focused on scaling and commercializing clinical treatments for diseases rooted in the microbiome. In 2017, he was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/profile/mark-smith-1/&quot;&gt;named&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;em&gt;Forbes &lt;/em&gt;30 Under 30 list for science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“OpenBiome and Finch Therapeutics were really a translation of the initial work that was done through the microbiology program, and a step toward developing those tools to improve human health,” Smith says. “The program taught me the foundational work I’ve come to rely on in almost every aspect of my job today.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Smith, Jacob Rubens PhD ’16 aims to apply his training at MIT to help develop new products. After working in Timothy Lu’s lab — straddling the realms of biological engineering and electrical engineering — Rubens joined Flagship Pioneering, a company that starts, funds, and runs breakthrough biotechnology startups in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Rubens was also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/profile/jacob-rubens/&quot;&gt;named&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; 30 Under 30 list for science in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the six years that Rubens was at MIT, he watched the microbiology cohort grow from roughly 20 to a force permeating more labs across campus than he could count.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;“It’s heartwarming to see people bringing a microbiological perspective into all these different spaces, and influencing cutting-edge research across the Institute,” he says. “As a microbiology student, you become an integrator and synthesizer of many different viewpoints, and a node to foster cross-talk between disciplines.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Niles prepares to assume the role of co-director in July 2018 and usher in the program’s second decade, he intends to maintain its integrity and structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The program has matured into what it is today thanks to a lot of previous, careful thought,” he says. “The students have indicated that there is a lot of value in the structure that we’ve refined over the years, and so my goal is to continue that positive momentum.”&lt;/p&gt;

 <guid isPermaLink="true">http://news.mit.edu/2017/new-engineering-faculty-1208</guid>
<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The School of Engineering has announced the addition of 16 new faculty members to its departments, institutes, labs, and centers during the 2017-18 and 2018-19 academic years. With research and teaching activities ranging from personalization in the microbiome to the application of machine learning to naval architecture, they are poised to make vast contributions in new directions across the school and to a range of labs and centers across the Institute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am pleased to welcome our exceptional new faculty. Their presence will enhance the breadth and depth of education and research within the School of Engineering, and strengthen MIT’s commitment to making a better world,” says Anantha Chandrakasan, dean of the School of Engineering. “I look forward to their contributions in the years to come.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new School of Engineering faculty members are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bryan Bryson&lt;/strong&gt; will join the Department of Biological Engineering as an assistant professor in the summer of 2018. Bryson earned a BS in mechanical engineering, with minor in biomedical engineering, and a PhD in biological engineering from MIT; his doctoral thesis was on proteomics and systems biology. He is currently completing postdoctoral work at the Harvard School of Public Health and the Ragon Institute, developing single-cell transcriptomic and proteomic methods for analysis of microbe-host interactions in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis. Bryson’s research program will center on systems biology approaches to infectious disease, primarily tuberculosis, and his teaching will include 20.440 (Analysis of Biological Networks), a graduate core subject on the analysis of biological networks, and 20.309 (Instrumentation and Measurement for Biological Systems), an undergraduate core laboratory subject on instrumentation and measurement for biological systems. Bryson served as a student representative on MIT’s last presidential search committee and was the recipient of numerous student awards at MIT, including the Hugh Hampton Young Fellowship for the combination of academic achievement with exceptional personal character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Luca Carlone &lt;/strong&gt;joins the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics as the Charles Stark Draper Assistant Professor this month. He will also be a principal investigator in the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS). Carlone received his PhD from the Polytechnic University of Turin in 2012, with a thesis entitled “Nonlinear Estimation Techniques for Autonomous Navigation in Single and Multi-robot Systems.” A research scientist at LIDS since 2016, Carlone first came to MIT as a postdoc in 2015, after two years as a postdoc at Georgia Tech. Carlone’s research interests include nonlinear estimation, numerical and distributed optimization, and probabilistic inference applied to sensing, perception, and decision making in single and multirobot systems. He is the recipient of several best-paper awards in his field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sili Deng &lt;/strong&gt;will join the Department of Mechanical Engineering as an assistant professor in January 2019. She received her PhD from Princeton University in 2016 and is currently doing postdoctoral work at Stanford University. Deng works in the area of combustion, with a focus on understanding flame dynamics and emissions during combustion processes. She performed both modeling and experiments to understand, characterize, and detect non-premixed cool-flame behavior for the first time, and she experimentally elucidated the sooting limits of diesel and biofuel surrogates in a simple liquid stagnation flow. She also investigated soot evolution in turbulent flames via modeling to provide insights into understanding both chemical and hydrodynamic effects on soot emissions. Deng has received several awards including the Bernard Lewis Fellowship from the Combustion Institute, the Gordon Wu Prize for Excellence from Princeton, which also awarded her an excellence in teaching award.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rafael Gomez-Bombarelli &lt;/strong&gt;will join the faculty in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering as an assistant professor in January 2018. He received a BS, MS, and PhD in chemistry from the University of Salamanca in Spain, followed by postdoctoral work at Heriot-Watt University and Harvard University. He is currently a senior researcher at Kyulux NA, applying Harvard-licensed technology to create commercial organic light-emitting diode products. Gomez-Bombarelli’s research has evolved from experimental mechanistic studies of organic molecules with an emphasis on environmental toxicity, to computer-driven design of molecular materials. By combining first-principles simulation with machine learning on theoretical and experimental datasets he aims to accelerate the discovery of novel practical materials. At MIT he plans to address the role of molecular transformation in materials discovery in areas such as catalyst design, the environmentally-minded development of novel and replacement chemicals, and designing for stability in advanced materials. Honors presented to Gomez-Bombarelli include the Spanish accreditation for Profesor Ayudante Doctor, and the University of Salamanca’s doctoral thesis award. His work has been featured in &lt;em&gt;MIT &lt;em&gt;Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;. He was also co-founder of Calculario, a materials discovery company that leverages quantum chemistry and machine learning to target advanced materials in a range of high-value markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Song Han &lt;/strong&gt;will join the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science as an assistant professor in July 2018. He received his master’s degree and PhD in electrical engineering from Stanford. His research focuses on energy-efficient deep learning at the intersection of machine learning and computer architecture. Han proposed the deep compression algorithm, which can compress neural networks by 17 to 49 times while fully preserving prediction accuracy. He also designed the first hardware accelerator that can perform inference directly on a compressed sparse model, which results in significant speed increases and energy saving. His work has been featured by O’Reilly, TechEmergence, and The Next Platform, among others. Han has won best-paper awards at the International Conference on Learning Representations and the International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phillip Isola &lt;/strong&gt;will join the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science as an assistant professor in July 2018. He received a bachelor’s degree in computer science from Yale University and a PhD in brain and cognitive sciences from MIT. Currently a fellow at OpenAI, Isola studies visual intelligence from the perspective of both minds and machines. He received a National Science Foundation (NSF) graduate fellowship as well as an NSF postdoctoral fellowship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tim Kraska &lt;/strong&gt;will join the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science as an associate professor in January 2018. Currently an assistant professor of computer science at Brown University, Kraska received a PhD from ETH Zurich, then spent three years as a postdoc in the AMPLab at the University of California at Berkeley, where he worked on hybrid human-machine database systems and cloud-scale data management systems.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mingda Li &lt;/strong&gt;will join the Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering as an assistant professor in January 2018. He completed his BS in engineering physics at Tsinghua University in 2009 and his PhD in nuclear science and engineering at MIT in 2015. After that, he carried out research as a postdoc at MIT’s Department of Mechanical Engineering. His Energy Nano Group aims to utilize defects to improve material performance through defect engineering, including experimental and theoretical studies on functional extended defects, controllable defective single crystal growth, AI-aided spectroscopy for defect resolution, and nanoscale energy transport and conversion processes with the presence of defects.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

eveloped new genomic approaches for understanding how bacteria evolve during infections of individual people. Lieberman is currently a postdoc in Eric J. Alm’s lab at MIT, where she has further developed and applied genomic approaches to understand the microbes that colonize the human body.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Des Marais &lt;/strong&gt;joined the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering as an assistant professor in October. He received his BA in integrative biology from the University of California at Berkeley, in 2000, studying plant diversity and evolution, and a PhD in biology from Duke University. His dissertation addressed how multifunctional proteins evolve within and between species. Des Marais did postdoctoral research at the University of Texas at Austin, where he was awarded a fellowship from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture to investigate plant responses to multiple environmental stresses experienced concurrently. Most recently, he was a principal investigator in the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology at Harvard, as well as a senior fellow at the Arnold Arboretum. Des Marais’ research interests are in plant ecophysiology, evolutionary biology, and functional genomics. He is particularly interested in plant interactions with the abiotic environment — water, temperature, nutrients, and light — and how plants respond when these factors impose stress. He studies natural diversity within and between plant species both in the field and in controlled environments, and he hopes to develop a mechanistic understanding or plant performance to conserve natural plant populations and to improve agricultural productivity and sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wim van Rees &lt;/strong&gt;joined the Department of Mechanical Engineering as an assistant professor this fall. He received a BS in marine technology in 2006 and an MS with honors in ship hydrodynamics in 2008 from the Delft University of Technology. In 2014, he earned a PhD in computational science and engineering. He joined Harvard as a postdoc in 2014. Van Rees’ work couples the most advanced computational fluid dynamics and structural mechanics available with modern machine learning to design ocean propulsion and energy harvesting systems by evolutionary optimization. His combined background in naval architecture, including design of an America’s Cup vessel, and advanced computational fluid dynamics is unique. The systems that van Rees develops are inspired by nature, but outperform similar biological systems through simulated evolutionary processes that are able to mitigate some disadvantageous constraints of biological evolution. His work has the possibility of transforming ocean utilization around the world through unconventional approaches to transportation and offshore structure design, including extraction of energy from wind, wave, and turbulence, and marine robotics. The advanced computational tools that van Rees has developed, along with the directions of his research, may also enable him to one day unravel the mysteries of turbulence by developing reliable predictive tools.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Boosting the antibiotic arsenal</title>
    <link>http://news.mit.edu/2017/boosting-antibiotic-arsenal-1207</link>
    <description>New strategy could enable existing drugs to kill bacteria that cause chronic infections.</description>

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MIT researchers have discovered a way to make bacteria more vulnerable to a class of antibiotics known as quinolones, which include ciprofloxacin and are often used to treat infections such as &lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new strategy overcomes a key limitation of these drugs, which is that they often fail against infections that feature a very high density of bacteria. These include many chronic, difficult-to-treat infections, such as &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;, often found in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients, and methicillin-resistant &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt; (MRSA).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Given that the number of new antibiotics being developed is diminishing, we face challenges in treating these infections. So efforts such as this could enable us to expand the efficacy of existing antibiotics,” says James Collins, the Termeer Professor of Medical Engineering and Science in MIT’s Institute for Medical Engineering and Science (IMES) and Department of Biological Engineering and the senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Arnaud Gutierrez, a former MIT postdoc, and Saloni Jain, a recent Boston University PhD recipient, are the lead authors of the study, which appears in the Dec. 7 online edition of &lt;em&gt;Molecular Cell&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overcoming bacterial defenses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bacteria that have become tolerant to a drug enter a physiological state that allows them to evade the drug’s action. (This is different from bacterial resistance, which occurs when microbes acquire genetic mutations that protect them from antibiotics.) “Tolerance is not well-understood, and we don’t have the means to circumvent it or overcome it,” Collins says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a study published in 2011, Collins and his colleagues found that they could increase the ability of antibiotics known as aminoglycosides to kill drug-tolerant bacteria by delivering a type of sugar along with the drug. The sugar helps to boost the metabolism of the bacteria, making it more likely that the microbes will undergo cell death in response to the DNA damage caused by the antibiotic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, aminoglycosides can have serious side effects, so they are not widely used. In their new study, Collins and his colleagues decided to explore whether they could use a similar approach to boost the effectiveness of quinolones, a class of antibiotics used more often than aminoglycosides. Quinolones work by interfering with bacterial enzymes called topoisomerases, which help with DNA replication and repair.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With quinolones, the researchers found that it wasn’t enough to add just sugar; they also had to add a type of molecule known as a terminal electron acceptor. Electron acceptors play an essential role in cellular respiration, the process that bacteria use to extract energy from sugar. In cells, the electron acceptor is usually oxygen, but other molecules, including fumarate, an acidic organic compound that is used as a food additive, can also be used.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In tests in high-density bacterial colonies grown in a lab dish, the researchers found that delivering quinolones along with glucose and fumarate could eliminate several types of bacteria, including &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus, &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Mycobacterium smegmatis, &lt;/em&gt;a close relative of the bacterium that causes tuberculosis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you simply add a carbon source like glucose, that’s not enough to enable the quinolone to kill. If you simply add oxygen, or another terminal electron acceptor, that by itself is not enough to cause killing either. But if you combine the two, you can eradicate the tolerant infection,” Collins says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metabolic state&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that high-density bacterial infections rapidly consume nutrients and oxygen from their environment, which then provokes them to enter a starvation state that helps them to survive. In this state, they greatly reduce their metabolic activity, which allows them to avoid the cell death pathway that is normally triggered when DNA is damaged by antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This finding highlights that the metabolic state of the bug significantly influences how the antibiotic will impact the bug. And, for the antibiotic to be effective as a killing agent, it requires downstream cellular respiration as part of the process,” Collins says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers now hope to test this approach in bacterial infections in animals, and they are also exploring how to best deliver the drug combination for different types of infections. A topical treatment could work well for &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt; infections, while an inhaled version could be used to treat &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; infections of the lungs, Collins says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Collins also hopes to test this approach with other types of antibiotics, including the class that includes penicillin and ampicillin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This study encourages work to find new ways to stimulate bacterial respiration and thereby enhance the production of reactive oxygen (or even non-oxygen) species during antibiotic treatment, for better eradication of bacterial pathogens, particularly those having low metabolic activity that may render them tolerant to antimicrobials,” says Karl Drlica, a professor at the Public Health Research Institute at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, who was not involved in the research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, and a gift from Anita and Josh Bekenstein.&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>New technique 3-D prints programmed cells into living devices for first time.

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MIT engineers have devised a 3-D printing technique that uses a new kind of ink made from genetically programmed living cells.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The cells are engineered to light up in response to a variety of stimuli. When mixed with a slurry of hydrogel and nutrients, the cells can be printed, layer by layer, to form three-dimensional, interactive structures and devices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team has then demonstrated its technique by printing a “living tattoo” — a thin, transparent patch patterned with live bacteria cells in the shape of a tree. Each branch of the tree is lined with cells sensitive to a different chemical or molecular compound. When the patch is adhered to skin that has been exposed to the same compounds, corresponding regions of the tree light up in response.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers, led by Xuanhe Zhao, the Noyce Career Development Professor in MIT’s Department of Mechanical Engineering, and Timothy Lu, associate professor of biological engineering and of electrical engineering and computer science, say that their technique can be used to fabricate “active” materials for wearable sensors and interactive displays. Such materials can be patterned with live cells engineered to sense environmental chemicals and pollutants as well as changes in pH and temperature.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s more, the team developed a model to predict the interactions between cells within a given 3-D-printed structure, under a variety of conditions. The team says researchers can use the model as a guide in designing responsive living materials.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zhao, Lu, and their colleagues have published their results today in the journal &lt;em&gt;Advanced Materials&lt;/em&gt;. The paper’s co-authors are graduate students Xinyue Liu, Hyunwoo Yuk, Shaoting Lin, German Alberto Parada, Tzu-Chieh Tang, Eléonore Tham, and postdoc Cesar de la Fuente-Nunez.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;cms-placeholder-content-video&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A hardy alternative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In recent years, scientists have explored a variety of responsive materials as the basis for 3D-printed inks. For instance, scientists have used inks made from temperature-sensitive polymers to print &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.mit.edu/2016/3-d-printed-structures-remember-shapes-drug-delivery-solar-panel-0826&quot;&gt;heat-responsive shape-shifting objects&lt;/a&gt;. Others have printed photoactivated structures from polymers that shrink and stretch in response to light. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zhao’s team, working with bioengineers in Lu’s lab, realized that live cells might also serve as responsive materials for 3D-printed inks, particularly as they can be genetically engineered to respond to a variety of stimuli. The researchers are not the first to consider 3-D printing genetically engineered cells; others have attempted to do so using live mammalian cells, but with little success.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It turns out those cells were dying during the printing process, because mammalian cells are basically lipid bilayer balloons,” Yuk says. “They are too weak, and they easily rupture.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead, the team identified a hardier cell type in bacteria. Bacterial cells have tough cell walls that are able to survive relatively harsh conditions, such as the forces applied to ink as it is pushed through a printer’s nozzle. Furthermore, bacteria, unlike mammalian cells, are compatible with most hydrogels — gel-like materials that are made from a mix of mostly water and a bit of polymer. The group found that hydrogels can provide an aqueous environment that can support living bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers carried out a screening test to identify the type of hydrogel that would best host bacterial cells. After an extensive search, a hydrogel with pluronic acid was found to be the most compatible material. The hydrogel also exhibited an ideal consistency for 3-D printing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This hydrogel has ideal flow characteristics for printing through a nozzle,” Zhao says. “It’s like squeezing out toothpaste. You need [the ink] to flow out of a nozzle like toothpaste, and it can maintain its shape after it’s printed.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From tattoos to living computers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lu provided the team with bacterial cells engineered to light up in response to a variety of chemical stimuli. The researchers then came up with a recipe for their 3-D ink, using a combination of bacteria, hydrogel, and nutrients to sustain the cells and maintain their functionality.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We found this new ink formula works very well and can print at a high resolution of about 30 micrometers per feature,” Zhao says. “That means each line we print contains only a few cells. We can also print relatively large-scale structures, measuring several centimeters.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They printed the ink using a custom 3-D printer that they built using standard elements combined with fixtures they machined themselves. To demonstrate the technique, the team printed a pattern of hydrogel with cells in the shape of a tree on an elastomer layer. After printing, they solidified, or cured, the patch by exposing it to ultraviolet radiation. They then adhere the transparent elastomer layer with the living patterns on it, to skin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To test the patch, the researchers smeared several chemical compounds onto the back of a test subject’s hand, then pressed the hydrogel patch over the exposed skin. Over several hours, branches of the patch’s tree lit up when bacteria sensed their corresponding chemical stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers also engineered bacteria to communicate with each other; for instance they programmed some cells to light up only when they receive a certain signa
00005827
l from another cell. To test this type of communication in a 3-D structure, they printed a thin sheet of hydrogel filaments with “input,” or signal-producing bacteria and chemicals, overlaid with another layer of filaments of an “output,” or signal-receiving bacteria. They found the output filaments lit up only when they overlapped and received input signals from corresponding bacteria .&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yuk says in the future, researchers may use the team’s technique to print “living computers” — structures with multiple types of cells that communicate with each other, passing signals back and forth, much like transistors on a microchip.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is very future work, but we expect to be able to print living computational platforms that could be wearable,” Yuk says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For more near-term applications, the researchers are aiming to fabricate customized sensors, in the form of flexible patches and stickers that could be engineered to detect a variety of chemical and molecular compounds. They also envision their technique may be used to manufacture drug capsules and surgical implants, containing cells engineered produce compounds such as glucose, to be released therapeutically over time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We can use bacterial cells like workers in a 3-D factory,” Liu says. “They can be engineered to produce drugs within a 3-D scaffold, and applications should not be confined to epidermal devices. As long as the fabrication method and approach are viable, applications such as implants and ingestibles should be possible.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This research was supported, in part, by the Office of Naval Research, National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, and MIT Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Revealing an imperfect actor in plant biotechnology</title>

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A research team led by MIT&#039;s Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research has harnessed metabolomic technologies to unravel the molecular activities of a key protein that&amp;nbsp;enables plants to withstand a common herbicide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their findings reveal how the protein — a kind of catalyst or enzyme&amp;nbsp;first isolated in bacteria and introduced into plants such as corn and soybeans&amp;nbsp;in the 1990s — can sometimes act imprecisely, and how it can be successfully re-engineered to be more precise. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41477-017-0061-1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, which appears online in the journal&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Nature Plants&lt;/em&gt;, raises the standards for bioengineering in the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our work underscores a critical aspect of bioengineering that we are now becoming technically able to address,” says senior author Jing-Ke Weng, a member of the Whitehead Institute and an assistant professor of biology at MIT. “We know that enzymes can behave indiscriminately. Now, we have the scientific capabilities to detect their molecular side effects, and we can leverage those insights to design smarter enzymes with enhanced specificity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plants provide an extraordinary model for scientists to study how metabolism changes over time. Because they cannot escape from predators or search for new food sources when supplies run low, plants must often grapple with an array of environmental insults using what is readily available — their own internal biochemistry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Although they appear to be stationary, plants have rapidly evolving metabolic systems,” Weng explains. “Now, we can gain an unprecedented view of these changes because of cutting-edge techniques like metabolomics, allowing us to analyze metabolites and other biochemicals on a broad scale.” &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key players in this evolutionary process, and a major focus of research in Weng’s laboratory, are enzymes. Traditionally, these naturally occurring catalysts have been viewed as mini-machines, taking the proper starting material (or substrate) and flawlessly converting it to the correct product. But Weng and other scientists now recognize that they make mistakes, often by latching on to an unintended substrate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This concept, known as enzyme promiscuity, has a variety of implications, both in enzyme evolution and more broadly, in human disease,” Weng says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also has implications for bioengineering, as Bastien Christ, a postdoctoral fellow in Weng’s laboratory, and his colleagues recently discovered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christ, then a graduate student in Stefan Hörtensteiner’s lab at the University of Zurich in Switzerland, was studying a particular strain of the flowering plant&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;as part of a separate project when he&amp;nbsp;made a puzzling observation. He found&amp;nbsp;that two biochemical compounds were present&amp;nbsp;at unusually high levels in the plant&#039;s&amp;nbsp;leaves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strangely, these compounds (called acetyl-aminoadipate and acetyl-tryptophan) weren’t present in any of the normal, so-called wild type plants. As he and his colleagues searched for an explanation, they narrowed in on the source: an enzyme, called BAR, that was engineered into the plants as a kind of chemical beacon, enabling scientists to more readily study them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But BAR is more than just a tool for scientists. It is also one of the most commonly deployed traits in genetically modified crops&amp;nbsp;such as soybeans, corn, and cotton, enabling them to withstand a widely-used herbicide (known as phosphinothricin or glufosinate).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For decades, scientists have known that BAR, originally isolated from bacteria, can render the herbicide inactive by tacking on a short string of chemicals, made of two carbons and one oxygen (also called an acetyl group). As the researchers describe in their&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Nature Plants&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;paper, BAR&amp;nbsp;has a promiscuous side, and can work on other substrates, too, such as the amino acids tryptophan and aminoadipate (a lysine derivative).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That explains why they can detect the unintended products (acetyl-tryptophan and acetyl-aminoadipate) in crops genetically engineered to carry BAR, such as soybeans and canola.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their research included detailed studies of the BAR protein, including crystal structures of the protein bound to its substrates. This provided them with a blueprint for how to strategically modify BAR to make it less promiscuous, and favor only the herbicide as a substrate and not the amino acids. Christ and his colleagues created several versions that lack the non-specific activity of the original BAR protein.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These are natural catalysts, so when we borrow them from an organism and put them into another, they may not necessarily be perfect for our purposes,” Christ says. “Gathering this kind of fundamental knowledge about how enzymes work and how their structure influences function can teach us how to select the best tools for bioengineering.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other important lessons, too. When the BAR trait was first evaluated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&amp;nbsp;in 1995&amp;nbsp;for use in canola, and in subsequent years for other crops,&amp;nbsp;metabolomics was largely non-existent as a technology for biomedical research. Therefore, it could not be applied toward the characterization of genetically engineered plants and foods, as part of their regulatory review. Nevertheless, acetyl-aminoadipate and acetyl-tryptophan, which are normally present in humans, have been reviewed by the FDA and are safe for human and animal consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weng and his colleagues believe their study makes a strong case for considering metabolomics analyses as part of the review process for future genetically engineered crops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is a cautionary tale,” Weng says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation, the EU-funded Plant Fellows program, the Pew Scholar Program in the Biomedical Sciences, and the Searle Scholars Program.&lt;/p&gt;

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Boston is home to two National Cancer Institute-designated cancer centers: MIT’s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research and the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC). Each works&amp;nbsp;to advance the fight against cancer in its own&amp;nbsp;unique way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latter draws on the collective resources of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI), Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston Children’s Hospital, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), Harvard Medical School (HMS), and Harvard T.H Chan School of Public Health. The Koch Institute (KI) integrates life sciences researchers with cancer-oriented engineers to develop new insights, tools, and technologies to detect, monitor, and treat the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work of the KI builds on that of its predecessor, the MIT Center for Cancer Research, which made seminal contributions to the understanding of cancer biology in its three-plus decades as MIT’s hub of cancer research. Clinical collaborations have been an important component of this enterprise for years —&amp;nbsp;but never on the scale of the Bridge Project. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bridge Project was &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.mit.edu/2012/koch-df-hcc-bridge-project-0306&quot;&gt;launched in 2012&lt;/a&gt; to provide seed funding for collaborative research teams comprised of investigators from both MIT and Harvard University. Its goal is to foster interdisciplinary studies that combine innovative tools and methods with the translational expertise of clinical oncologists to solve today’s most challenging problems in cancer research and care. It is a simple idea, uniquely suited to this community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In Boston, we are blessed with differently focused, world-class cancer researchers on both sides of the Charles River,” says founding donor Arthur Gelb ScD ’61, who is an emeritus trustee of DFCI and an emeritus MIT Corporation member. “The Bridge Project’s operating presumption is that spanning the gap between them — to enable truly joint research at the intersection of their disciplines — is destined to produce new, highly original, and powerful approaches to defeating cancer. The early history of the Bridge Project suggests that is exactly the case.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIT President Emerita Susan Hockfield says&amp;nbsp;Gelb “had advocated collaboration between MIT and DF/HCC for a long time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“He presented the idea to me in one of our very first conversations, shortly after I became president,” Hockfield explains. “But we didn’t have a vehicle to make it happen until the KI.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the Koch Institute opened its interdisciplinary doors in 2011, the Bridge Project was one of the first initiatives to walk through them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fast-moving research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first funding cycle was modest, yet aspirational. Four grants were awarded to target two of the most deadly, hard-to-treat cancer types — brain and pancreatic. In subsequent cycles, the Bridge Project expanded to include several additional high-need disease areas, including advanced breast cancer, aggressive lung cancer, and notoriously hard-to-detect ovarian cancer, and brought the total number of projects funded to 15 within the first four years of the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among these efforts was a project by KI member Angela Belcher, the James Mason Crafts Professor and professor of biological engineering and materials science and engineering at MIT, who teamed up with oncologists Michael Birrer, then the director of medical gynecologic oncology at MGH, and professor of medicine at HMS, and Marcela del Carmen, an associate professor of gynecologic oncology at MGH and professor of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology at HMS, to adapt and refine the Belcher laboratory’s highly sensitive optical imaging system harnessing genetically-engineered, nanoscale fluorescent probes for early detection, real-time imaging, and monitoring of ovarian cancers. The team initially piloted the technology as a tool for image-guided surgery, and is now using it in advanced pre-clinical investigations for diagnostics and therapy of early-stage tumors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another early-funded project, led by MIT associate professor of bology and KI member Matthew Vander Heiden and fellow physician-scientists William Kaelin Jr., a professor of medicine at DFCI and HMS, and Daniel Cahill, an assistant professor of neurosurgery at HMS and MGH, was focused on the development of a new imaging modality for tumors known as IDH-mutant gliomas. Their approach is being tested as a way to&amp;nbsp;monitor drug response in patients with these tumors. The project also supported the&amp;nbsp;discovery of novel&amp;nbsp;approaches&amp;nbsp;to target these cancers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Projects like these were just the beginning, says Tyler Jacks, director of the Koch Institute and co-leader of the Bridge Project. “As the Bridge Project gained momentum, so did the possibilities. The standards are very high — we are looking for true collaborations, rooted in real clinical need and fueled by truly innovative approaches. In exchange, we are able to catalyze progress and bring real advances to patients, very quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is it about these projects that makes them so promising? “There’s a continuum of discovery,” explains Jacks’ co-leader David Livingston, deputy director of DF/HCC, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2017-03-03/bay-state-biotech-report-the-bridge-project&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;in an interview&lt;/a&gt; with Bloomberg Radio. “[It] begins in basic research laboratories, goes to patients in clinics and hospitals, and then comes back, and turns into new therapeutics or new diagnostics or a new ability to figure out how [a] tumor is going to behave.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This quick-paced cycle of discovery and innovation, coupled with clinical application, is why investors and others find the Bridge Project so appealing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2015, the Bridge Project received a &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.mit.edu/2015/20-million-commonwealth-foundation-cancer-research-challenge-gift-expand-collaborative-cancer&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;$20 million challenge grant&lt;/a&gt; from the Commonwealth Foundation for Cancer Research to further expand the program; this doubled the number of projects to be funded and introduced new Footbridge grants,&amp;nbsp;for proof-of-concept studies, and Expansion Bridge grants to rapidly launch clinical trials. One of the first expansion projects is moving a new MIT-developed vaccine technology into clinical trials for lung cancer at DFCI. A second, a collaboration between KI member Michael Hemann, an associate professor of Biology at MIT; David Weinstock, an associate professor of medicine at DFCI and HMS; and Ann LaCasce, an assistant professor in medicine at HMS and instructor in medical oncology at DFCI, is already seeing promising results in active Phase 1 trials for lymphoma-targeting combination therapy. Other projects, new and continuing, will spring into action as additional funds are raised toward this challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An additional research focus on pediatric brain cancer, initiated in 2016, spawned three new off-cycle projects, including the first-ever Bridge Project super-team,&amp;nbsp;consisting of eight laboratories across Harvard and MIT, combining expertise in genomics, cell signaling, immunology, microfluidics, and nanotechnology, to develop non-invasive diagnostics and combination therapeutics to target aggressive gliomas in young patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to continuing support from philanthropic donors, and the tireless work of researchers, administrators, and reviewers, the Bridge Project has processed 160 applications and funded 37 projects led by researchers from 78 laboratories at MIT and DF/HCC. Each project includes researchers from both sides of the Charles River: 92 percent of past Bridge Project teams have joint publications, and 11 invention disclosures have been filed. The program, which is entirely supported by philanthropy, has raised more than $30 million, but there is more work to be done, especially in regard to the challenge grant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investing in success&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bridge Project research is poised to directly improve patient outcomes&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;A collaboration between Weinstock and KI member Scott Manalis, the Andrew and Erna Viterbi Professor and professor of biological and mechanical engineering, has seen startling success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their initial proposal to use a novel microfluidic device to measure the drug sensitivity of tumor cells has proven successful across a variety of cancer types. With&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://news.mit.edu/2016/predict-tumor-responses-measuring-cell-growth-drug-exposure-1010&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;published results&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;in studying both acute lymphoblastic leukemia and glioblastoma multiforme, the MIT team’s cell-weighing technology is now being evaluated in a clinical laboratory at DFCI in which live cells from an individual patient can be exposed to different drugs to measure sensitivity, with the ultimate goal of determining if the technology can identify the best course of treatment for that patient. Their approach has seen &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.mit.edu/2017/cell-weighing-method-could-help-doctors-choose-cancer-drugs-1120&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;particular success&lt;/a&gt; in mirroring how patients with multiple myeloma respond to different therapies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The KI/DFCI collaboration also earned a prestigious U54 grant from the National Cancer Institute, amplifying the effect of the Bridge Project work through federal funding and multi-institutional support. The technology is being further developed by Travera, the team’s newly-launched startup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, entrepreneurship offers yet another path to clinical translation. MIT spinoff &lt;a href=&quot;http://panthertx.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PanTher&amp;nbsp;Therapeutics&lt;/a&gt;, focused on improving therapeutic solutions to inoperable&amp;nbsp;solid tumors, grew directly out of a Bridge Project grant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Bridge Project gave us the money to do the science,” says&amp;nbsp;CEO Laura Indolfi, a former postdoc in the laboratory of KI member Elazer Edelman, the Thomas D. and Virginia W. Cabot Professor of Health Sciences and Technology. “Once we saw the results — a &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.mit.edu/2016/implantable-device-targets-pancreatic-cancer-0414&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;12&amp;nbsp;times&amp;nbsp;improvement&lt;/a&gt; in response rate&amp;nbsp;for pancreatic cancer — we were able to take that proof-of-concept to&amp;nbsp;business validation as a finalist in the MIT $100K&amp;nbsp;Entrepreneurship Competition, and incubate it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With support from MIT’s Deshpande Center for Technological Innovation, 
00004000
Indolfi and her team were able to de-risk the project and scale it up, launching PanTher in 2015. The team then won a “golden ticket” to LabCentral from Bristol-Myers Squibb in 2016, providing the company with lab space to further develop&amp;nbsp;their technology. They are currently transitioning from seed funding to Series A and hope to begin clinical trials in 2019; conversations with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are already underway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such clinical impact is usually a long way off for university researchers. The typical “bench to bedside” trajectory is on the order of a decade or more; to have so many projects in pre-clinical studies, pursuing FDA approval for clinical trials in such a short period of time is a testament to the Bridge Project’s goal of meeting the most urgent, unmet needs of cancer care.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beyond the bridge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bridge Project has yielded unexpected benefits for researchers. Following the review of their collaborative Bridge Project application, KI member Darrell Irvine, a professor of biological engineering and materials science and engineering at MIT, and two DFCI immunologists, Michael Goldberg, an assistant professor of cancer immunology and virology at DFCI and assistant professor of microbiology and immunobiology at HMS, and&amp;nbsp;Kai Wucherpfennig, director of DFCI’s Center for Cancer Immunotherapy Research and a professor of microbiology and immunobiology at HMS, decided to apply together for outside funding to support their proposed work. In 2014, they received a prominent Team Science Award from the Melanoma Research Association to improve the use of immunotherapy in cancer treatment through targeted nanoparticle delivery of small molecule drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also instances of Bridge Project research changing the course of investigators’ career paths. Indolfi, for example, took on the drug delivery work of her advisor’s Bridge Project award as a side project, never imagining that it would be spun out and lead her into entrepreneurship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former MIT Department of Biology graduate student Mark Stevens, on the other hand, was positive that he was industry-bound when he joined the Manalis Lab. However, as&amp;nbsp;he was starting to wrap up his initial thesis work using the lab’s&amp;nbsp;microfluidic device to measure the masses of cells to learn about their metabolic properties, he became attracted to his advisor’s nascent collaboration&amp;nbsp;with DFCI, which was just taking off. He was drawn to the project’s potential for patient-centric development, and&amp;nbsp;using cell&amp;nbsp;lines, mouse models, and patient samples&amp;nbsp;from the collaborating labs at DFCI,&amp;nbsp;ultimately added a component focused on testing for tumor drug susceptibility to his thesis.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two years past his PhD thesis defense,&amp;nbsp;Stevens now holds a joint appointment between MIT and DFCI,&amp;nbsp;driven by the Bridge Project’s support,&amp;nbsp;where aforementioned clinical studies with the&amp;nbsp;cell-weighing technology are ongoing. He describes this new position as an opportunity to provide much-needed translation, in every sense of the word, between academic and clinical settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There is a&amp;nbsp;lot of lip service paid to interdisciplinary research, which can have less familiar, or well-defined metrics for success,” Stevens says. “This uncertainty leads to an environment where&amp;nbsp;what is actually supported is relatively subject-specific, niche expertise. Programs like the Bridge Project provide a&amp;nbsp;context where interdisciplinary&amp;nbsp;boundaries&amp;nbsp;can really be pushed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, Stevens finds himself in what he calls a “nexus” position: working to make connections between fundamental biology&amp;nbsp;research and clinical need, and pushing research forward on a much faster timescale than he had originally anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such accelerated trajectories were exactly what Gelb had in mind when he first approached the institutional leaders about the potential partnership. The collaborative nature of the work, Gelb says, provides “viewpoints, tools, and methods that would not necessarily occur to researchers focused only on the underlying biology, important as that may be.” This multidisciplinary perspective is, with every new project, reshaping the way cancer researchers talk to and learn from each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, one can argue that many of these conversations would or could have happened without an official agreement, but like so many scientific endeavors, making connections is key — among researchers and investors alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Bridge Project got off the ground through philanthropic funding,” says Hockfield. “It would have been impossible for us to make those clinically relevant projects work if we had had to wait for the standard grant mechanisms.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These initial investments in the Bridge Project are paying off, in the clinic, in the marketplace, and in an increasingly resource-challenged research environment. In September, the Bridge Project was honored by Boston’s life sciences and biotech community, having been chosen by a panel of judges as the winning “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xconomy.com/boston/2017/10/16/bridge-project-qa-big-idea-winners-on-connecting-cancer-experts/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Big Idea&lt;/a&gt;” at the Xconomy inaugural awards ceremony. Additionally, the collaboration has been credited by some for contributing to the high scores that both partnering institutions received on their respective Cancer Center Support Grant reviews by the National Cancer Institute in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the research will not rest on these laurels, nor will the people behind it. The Bridge Project is, at its heart, about people — patients, researchers, physicians, and all those who keep its momentum moving forward. The Bridge Project is about rapid acceleration of progress. The ideas and technologies being developed in research laboratories have the potential to affect the cancer patients of today and tomorrow, but it is the investigators themselves, together with their philanthropic partners, who are, at an unprecedented rate, bridging the gaps between bench and bedside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Doctors have many drugs available to treat multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer. However, there is no way to predict, by genetic markers or other means, how a patient will respond to a particular drug. This can lead to months of treatment with a drug that isn’t working.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers at MIT have now shown that they can use a new type of measurement to predict how drugs will affect cancer cells taken from multiple-myeloma patients. Furthermore, they showed that their predictions correlated with how those patients actually fared when treated with those drugs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This type of testing could help doctors predict drug responses based on measurements of cancer cell growth rates after drug exposure, says Scott Manalis, the Andrew and Erna Viterbi Professor in the MIT departments of Biological Engineering and Mechanical Engineering and a member of MIT’s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“For infectious diseases, antibiotic susceptibility testing based on cell proliferation has been extremely effective for many decades,” Manalis says. “Unlike bacteria, analogous tests for tumor cells have been challenging, in part because the cells don’t always proliferate upon removal from the patient. The measurement we developed doesn’t require proliferation.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Manalis is the senior author of the study, which appears in the Nov. 20 issue of &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;. The paper’s lead authors are Mark Stevens, a visiting scientist at the Koch Institute and research scientist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Arif Cetin, a former MIT postdoc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/sites/mit.edu.newsoffice/files/device.gif&quot; style=&quot;width: 595px; height: 335px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10px;&quot;&gt;An animation of how a serial suspended micro channel resonator functions with cells flowing through the device. Cells pass over 10 cantilever mass sensors to have their mass weighed over a 15 minute interval, with measurements spaced by delay channels. Multiple measurements allow the researchers to capture changes in mass over time, a metric called mass accumulation rate (MAR).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predicting response&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers’ new strategy is based on technology that Manalis and others in his lab have developed over the past several years to weigh cells. Their device, known as a suspended microchannel resonator (SMR), can measure cell masses 10 to 100 times more accurately than any other technique, allowing the researchers to precisely calculate growth rates of single cells over short periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The latest version of the device, which can measure 50 to 100 cells per hour, consists of a series of SMR sensors that weigh cells as they flow through tiny channels. Over a 20-minute period, each cell is weighed 10 times, which is enough to get an accurate MAR measurement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, Manalis and colleagues set out to adapt this technique to predict how cancer drugs affect tumor cell growth. They showed last year that the mass accumulation rate (MAR), a measurement of the rate at which the cells gain mass, can reveal drug susceptibility. A decrease in MAR following drug treatment means the cells are sensitive to the drug, but if they are resistant, there is no change in MAR.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the new study, the researchers teamed up with Nikhil Munshi at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute to test a variety of drugs on tumor cells from multiple-myeloma patients. They then compared the results to what happened when the patients were treated with those drugs. For each patient, they tracked the cells’ response to three different drugs, plus several combinations of those drugs. They found that in all nine cases, their data matched the outcomes seen in patients, as measured by clinical protein biomarkers found in the bloodstream, which are used by doctors to determine whether a drug is killing the tumor cells.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When the clinical biomarkers showed that the patients should be sensitive to a drug, we also saw sensitivity by our measurement. Whereas in cases where the patients were resistant, we saw that in the clinical biomarkers as well as our measurement,” Stevens says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personalized medicine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the difficulties in treating multiple myeloma is choosing among the many drugs available. Patients usually respond well to the first round of treatment but eventually relapse, at which point doctors must choose another drug. However, there is no way to predict which drug would be best for that particular patient at that time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In one scenario, the researchers envision that their sensor would be used at the time of disease relapse, when the tumor may have developed resistance to specific therapies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“At this time of relapse, we would take a bone marrow biopsy from a patient, and we would test each therapy individually or in combinations that are typically used in the clinic. At that point we’d be able to inform the clinician as to which therapy or combinations of therapies this patient seems to be most sensitive or most resistant to,” Stevens says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new test holds “great promise” to screen myeloma cells for drug susceptibility, says Kenneth Anderson, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, who was not involved in the research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This assay may fast-forward personalized medical care and the choice of effective therapies for myeloma both at diagnosis and at relapse,” Anderson says.&amp;nbsp;“It may also be useful to profile susceptibility of minimal residual disease in order to further inform therapy and improve patient outcome.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bone marrow biopsies often produce limited numbers of tumor cells to test — as few as 50,000 tumor cells in this study — but for this technique that is enough to test many different drugs and drug combinations. The MIT researchers have started a company to begin a larger clinical study for validating this approach, and they plan to investigate the possibility of using this technology for other types of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health, the Koch Institute’s Cancer Center Support (core) Grant from the National Cancer Institute, the Department of Veterans Affairs, a Koch Institute Quinquennial Cancer Research Fellowship, and the Bridge Project of the Koch Institute and Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center.&lt;/p&gt;

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Microbes living in your gut may help protect against the effects of a high-salt diet, according to a new study from MIT.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The MIT team, working with researchers in Germany, found that in both mice and humans, a high-salt diet shrinks the population of a certain type of beneficial bacteria. As a result, pro-inflammatory immune cells called Th-17 cells grow in number. These immune cells have been linked with high blood pressure, although the exact mechanism of how they contribute to hypertension is not yet known.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers further showed that treatment with a probiotic could reverse these effects, but they caution that people should not interpret the findings as license to eat as much salt as they want, as long as they take a probiotic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think certainly there’s some promise in developing probiotics that could be targeted to possibly fixing some of the effects of a high-salt diet, but people shouldn’t think they can eat fast food and then pop a probiotic, and it will be canceled out,” says Eric Alm, director of MIT’s Center for Microbiome Informatics and Therapeutics and a professor of biological engineering and civil and environmental engineering at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alm, Dominik Muller of the Max-Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine in Berlin, and Ralf Linker of Friedrich-Alexander University in Erlangen, Germany, are the senior authors of the study, which is published today in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. The paper’s lead author is Nicola Wilck of the Max-Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine. Authors from MIT include graduate students Mariana Matus and Sean Kearney, and recent PhD recipient Scott Olesen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Too much salt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists have long known that a high-salt diet can lead to cardiovascular disease. As sodium accumulates in the bloodstream, the body retains more fluid to dilute the sodium, and the heart and blood vessels have to work harder to pump the extra volume of water. This can stiffen the blood vessels, potentially leading to high blood pressure, heart attack, and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Recent evidence has also implicated the body’s immune system in some of the effects of a high-salt diet. Muller’s lab has previously shown that salt increases the population of Th-17 immune cells, which stimulate inflammation and can lead to hypertension. Muller and his colleagues have also found that excess salt can drive the development of an autoimmune disease that is similar to multiple sclerosis, in mice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Alm’s lab has studied interactions of human gut microbes with populations of different types of immune cells. He has shown that the balance between pro-inflammatory cells such as Th-17 and anti-inflammatory cells is influenced by the composition of the gut microbiome. The researchers have also found that probiotics can tip this balance in favor of anti-inflammatory cells.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the new study, the researchers teamed up to determine how a high-salt diet would affect the microbiome, and whether those changes might be linked to the detrimental health effects of such a diet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For two weeks, the researchers fed mice a diet in which sodium chloride (table salt) made up 4 percent of what the animals were eating, compared to 0.5 percent for mice on a normal diet. They found that this diet led to a drop in the population of a type of bacteria called &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus murinus&lt;/em&gt;. These mice also had greater populations of inflammatory Th-17 cells, and their blood pressure went up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When mice experiencing high blood pressure were given a probiotic containing &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus murinus, &lt;/em&gt;Th-17 populations went down and hypertension was reduced.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a study of 12 human subjects, the researchers found that adding 6,000 milligrams of sodium chloride per day to the subjects’ diet, for a duration of two weeks, also changed the composition of bacteria in the gut. Populations of &lt;em&gt;lactobacillus&lt;/em&gt; bacteria went down, and the subjects’ blood pressure went up along with their counts of Th-17 cells.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When subjects were given a commercially available probiotic for a week before going on a high-salt diet, their gut &lt;em&gt;lactobacillus&lt;/em&gt; levels and blood pressure remained normal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A smoking gun&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is still unclear exactly how Th-17 cells contribute to the development of high blood pressure and other ill effects of a high-salt diet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re learning that the immune system exerts a lot of control on the body, above and beyond what we generally think of as immunity,” Alm says. “The mechanisms by which it exerts that control are still being unraveled.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers hope that their findings, along with future studies, will help to shed more light on the mechanism by which a high-salt diet influences disease. “If you can find that smoking gun and uncover the complete molecular details of what’s going on, you may make it more likely that people adhere to a healthy diet,” Alm says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alm and others at the Center for Microbiome Informatics and Therapeutics are also studying how other dietary factors such as fiber, fat, and protein affect the microbiome. They have collected thousands of different strains of bacteria representing the most abundant species in the human gut, and they hope to learn more about the relationships between these bacteria, diet, and diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by the German Center for Cardiovascular Research, the MIT Center for Microbiome Informatics and Therapeutics, and the MetaCardis consortium.&lt;/p&gt;

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Researchers at MIT and Paris Descartes University have developed a new optogenetic technique that sculpts light to target individual cells bearing engineered light-sensitive molecules, so that individual neurons can be precisely stimulated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Until now, it has been challenging to use optogenetics to target single cells with such precise control over both the timing and location of the activation. This new advance paves the way for studies of how individual cells, and connections among those cells, generate specific behaviors such as initiating a movement or learning a new skill.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Ideally what you would like to do is play the brain like a piano. You would want to control neurons independently, rather than having them all march in lockstep the way traditional optogenetics works, but which normally the brain doesn’t do,” says Ed Boyden, an associate professor of brain and cognitive sciences and biological engineering at MIT, and a member of MIT’s Media Lab and McGovern Institute for Brain Research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new technique relies on a new type of light-sensitive protein that can be embedded in neuron cell bodies, combined with holographic light-shaping that can focus light on a single cell.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Boyden and Valentina Emiliani, a research director at France’s National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) and director of the Neurophotonics Laboratory at Paris Descartes University, are the senior authors of the study, which appears in the Nov. 13 issue of &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;. The lead authors are MIT postdoc Or Shemesh and CNRS postdocs Dimitrii Tanese and Valeria Zampini.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Precise control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More than 10 years ago, Boyden and his collaborators first pioneered the use of light-sensitive proteins known as microbial opsins to manipulate neuron electrical activity. These opsins can be embedded into the membranes of neurons, and when they are exposed to certain wavelengths of light, they silence or stimulate the cells.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, scientists have used this technique to study how populations of neurons behave during brain tasks such as memory recall or habit formation. Traditionally, many cells are targeted simultaneously because the light shining into the brain strikes a relatively large area. However, as Boyden points out, neurons may have different functions even when they are near each other.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Two adjacent cells can have completely different neural codes. They can do completely different things, respond to different stimuli, and play different activity patterns during different tasks,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To achieve independent control of single cells, the researchers combined two new advances: a localized, more powerful opsin and an optimized holographic light-shaping microscope.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the opsin, the researchers used a protein called CoChR, which the Boyden lab discovered in 2014. They chose this molecule because it generates a very strong electric current in response to light (about 10 times stronger than that produced by channelrhodopsin-2, the first protein used for optogenetics).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They fused CoChR to a small protein that directs the opsin into the cell bodies of neurons and away from axons and dendrites, which extend from the neuron body. This helps to prevent crosstalk between neurons, since light that activates one neuron can also strike axons and dendrites of other neurons that intertwine with the target neuron.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Boyden then worked with Emiliani to combine this approach with a light-stimulation technique that she had previously developed, known as two-photon computer-generated holography (CGH). This can be used to create three-dimensional sculptures of light that envelop a target cell.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Traditional holography is based on reproducing, with light, the shape of a specific object, in the absence of that original object. This is achieved by creating an “interferogram” that contains the information needed to reconstruct an object that was previously illuminated by a reference beam. In computer generated holography, the interferogram is calculated by a computer without the need of any original object. Years ago, Emiliani’s research group demonstrated that combined with two-photon excitation, CGH can be used to refocus laser light to precisely illuminate a cell or a defined group of cells in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the new study, by combining this approach with new opsins that cluster in the cell body, the researchers showed they could stimulate individual neurons with not only precise spatial control but also great control over the timing of the stimulation. When they target a specific neuron, it responds consistently every time, with variability that is less than one millisecond, even when the cell is stimulated many times in a row.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“For the first time ever, we can bring the precision of single-cell control toward the natural timescales of neural computation,” Boyden says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mapping connections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using this technique, the researchers were able to stimulate single neurons in brain slices and then measure the responses from cells that are connected to that cell. This paves the way for possible diagramming of the connections of the brain, and analyzing how those connections change in real time as the brain performs a task or learns a new skill.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One possible experiment, Boyden says, would be to stimulate neurons connected to each other to try to figure out if one is controlling the others or if they are all receiving input from a far-off controller.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s an open question,” he says. “Is a given function being driven from afar, or is there a local circuit that governs the dynamics and spells out the exact chain of command within a circuit? If you can catch that chain of command in action and then use this technology to prove that that’s actually a causal link of events, that could help you explain how a sensation, or movement, or decision occurs.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a step toward that type of study, the researchers now plan to extend this approach into living animals. They are also working on improving their targeting molecules and developing high-current opsins that can silence neuron activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kirill Volynski, a professor at the Institute of Neurology at University College London, who was not involved in the research, plans to use the new technology in his studies of diseases caused by mutations of proteins involved in synaptic communication between neurons. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This gives us a very nice tool to study those mutations and those disorders,” Volynski says. “We expect this to enable a major improvement in the specificity of stimulating neurons that have mutated synaptic proteins.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health, France’s National Research Agency, the Simons Foundation for the Social Brain, the Human Frontiers Science Program, John Doerr, the Open Philanthropy Project, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.&lt;/p&gt;

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;By organizing pigments on a DNA scaffold, an MIT-led team of researchers has designed a light-harvesting material that closely mimics the structure of naturally occurring photosynthetic structures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers showed that their synthetic material can absorb light and efficiently transfer its energy along precisely controlled pathways. This type of structure could be incorporated into materials such as glass or textiles, enabling them to harvest or otherwise control incoming energy from sunlight, says Mark Bathe, an associate professor of biological engineering at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is the first demonstration of a purely synthetic mimic of a natural light-harvesting circuit that consists of densely packed clusters of dyes that are precisely organized spatially at the nanometer scale, as found in bacterial systems,” Bathe says. One nanometer is one billionth of a meter, or 1/10,000 the thickness of a human hair.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bathe is one of the senior authors of the new study, along with Alan Aspuru-Guzik, a professor of chemistry and chemical biology at Harvard University, and Hao Yan, a professor of chemistry and biochemistry at Arizona State University. Lead authors of the paper, which appears in the Nov. 13 issue of &lt;em&gt;Nature Materials&lt;/em&gt;, are former MIT postdoc Etienne Boulais, Harvard graduate student Nicolas Sawaya, and MIT postdoc Rémi Veneziano.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capturing light&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over billions of years, plants and photosynthetic bacteria have evolved efficient cellular structures for harvesting energy from the sun. This process requires capturing photons (packets of light energy) and converting them into excitons — a special type of quasiparticle that can carry energy. Energy from these excitons is then passed to other molecules at a complex of protein and pigments known as a reaction center, and eventually used by the plant to build sugar molecules.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While scientists have developed reliable techniques for carrying electrons (such as semiconductors) and photons (fiber optics), coming up with ways to control excitons has proven more challenging.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Four years ago, Bathe, Aspuru-Guzik, and Yan began working on synthetic structures that could mimic natural light-harvesting assemblies. These assemblies, usually found in cell organelles called chloroplasts, have an intricate structure that efficiently captures and transports solar energy at the scale of nanometers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What’s really amazing about photosynthetic light-harvesting is how well it meets the organism’s needs,” says Gabriela Schlau-Cohen, an MIT assistant professor of chemistry who is also an author of the paper. “When it is required, every absorbed photon can migrate through the network of proteins that surrounds the reaction center, to generate electricity.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers set out to mimic these structures by attaching light-harvesting pigments to study scaffolds made of DNA. Over the past several years, Bathe’s lab has devised new ways to program DNA to fold in particular shapes, and last year Bathe and his colleagues created a new computer-programming tool that automates the process of designing DNA scaffolds of nearly any shape.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For this study, the researchers wanted to use DNA scaffolds to spatially organize densely packed clusters of pigments similar to those found in nature. Boulais found a 1977 paper that showed that a synthetic pigment called pseudoisocyanine (PIC) aggregates onto specific sequences of naturally occurring DNA to form the type of structure the researchers were seeking, called a J-aggregate. However, because this approach used naturally occurring DNA, there was no way to control the spacing, size, or 3-D spatial organization of the clusters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Veneziano tested the researchers’ ability to template these J-aggregates into discrete clusters with distinct 2-D organizations using synthetic DNA, and Boulais and Sawaya worked to computationally design customizable, synthetic DNA scaffolds that organize these aggregates into circuits that absorb photons and transport the resulting excitons along a predictable path. By programming specific DNA sequences, the researchers can control the precise location and density of the clusters of dye molecules, which sit on a rigid, double-stranded DNA scaffold. They computationally modeled how factors such as the number of dye molecules, their orientation, and the distances between them would affect the efficiency of the resulting circuits, analyzing many versions of the circuits for their efficiency of energy transfer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Photosynthetic organisms organize their light-harvesting molecules precisely using a protein scaffold. Up to now, this kind of structural control has been difficult to realize in synthetic systems. It looks like DNA origami provides a means of mimicking many of the principles of photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes,” says Gregory Scholes, a professor of chemistry at Princeton University who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Part of the ASU team, led by co-author Su Lin, performed a series of spectroscopic measurements to demonstrate that the designed DNA structures produced the desired J-aggregates, and to characterize their photophysical properties. Schlau-Cohen, who uses advanced spectroscopy techniques to analyze light-harvesting systems, both natural and synthetic, showed that these dense pigment assemblies were able to efficiently absorb light energy and transport it along specific pathways.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We demonstrated the ability to control the traffic patterns using J-aggregated dyes, not just how far the excitons can travel. That’s important because it offers versatility in designing such circuits for functional materials,” Bathe says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Bottom-up design of excitonics systems has been a focused goal of our Energy Frontiers Research Center (EFRC). I am glad to see an important stepping stone toward demonstrating bottom-up control of exciton flow,” Aspuru-Guzik says. He adds that “multidisciplinary research that tightly couples synthesis, theory, and characterization was required to get to this point.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New materials&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers believe that these synthetic structures could be integrated into 2-D and 3-D materials such as glass or textiles, giving those materials the ability to absorb sunlight and convert it into other forms of energy such as electricity, or to otherwise store or harness the energy. The structures might also form a new basis for quantum computers, implemented at the nanoscale, using excitonic circuits as quantum logic gates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers now plan to explore ways to make these synthetic light-harvesting systems even better, including looking for more efficient pigments, which may lie in the recently announced Max Weaver Dye Library at North Carolina State University, which houses 98,000 unique dyes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There are still a lot of ways that we can imagine improving this,” Schlau-Cohen says. “We have the ability to control individual molecular parameters to explore the basic science questions of how can we transport energy efficiently in a disordered material.” Schlau-Cohen is also the senior author of a companion publication that will be published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters&lt;/em&gt; next week.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other authors of the &lt;em&gt;Nature Materials&lt;/em&gt; paper are MIT postdocs James Banal and Toru Kondo, who led the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters&lt;/em&gt; paper; former ASU postdoc Alessio Andreoni; ASU postdoc Sarthak Mandal; ASU Senior Research Professor Su Lin; and ASU Professor Neal Woodbury.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by the U.S. Department of Defense’s Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative, the U.S. Department of Energy through MIT’s Center for Excitonics, the Office of Naval Research, a Smith Family Graduate Science and Engineering Fellowship, and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
